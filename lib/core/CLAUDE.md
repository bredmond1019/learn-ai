# Core Infrastructure Documentation

This directory contains essential infrastructure components that support the entire application.

## Infrastructure Components

### ðŸ“¦ Caching System (`/caching`)
See [caching/CLAUDE.md](./caching/CLAUDE.md) for cache management documentation including:
- LRU cache implementation
- Multi-namespace support
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Performance optimization

### ðŸ”§ Environment Configuration (`/environment`)
See [environment/CLAUDE.md](./environment/CLAUDE.md) for environment documentation including:
- Environment variable management
- Type-safe configuration
- Feature flags
- Security considerations

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Logging (`/monitoring`)
See [monitoring/CLAUDE.md](./monitoring/CLAUDE.md) for observability documentation including:
- Structured logging
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Production debugging

### ðŸ”’ Security (`/security`)
See [security/CLAUDE.md](./security/CLAUDE.md) for security documentation including:
- Rate limiting implementation
- Request validation
- Security headers
- Protection strategies

### ðŸ§­ Navigation
The `navigation.ts` file provides navigation utilities:
- Route generation helpers
- Active route detection
- Locale-aware navigation
- Type-safe route definitions

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Each subdirectory handles a specific infrastructure concern, maintaining clear boundaries and responsibilities.

### 2. Type Safety
All core components are fully typed with TypeScript, providing compile-time safety and better developer experience.

### 3. Performance First
Infrastructure components are optimized for performance with caching, lazy loading, and efficient algorithms.

### 4. Security by Design
Security considerations are built into the infrastructure layer, not added as an afterthought.

### 5. Observability
Comprehensive logging and monitoring ensure visibility into system behavior in production.

## Common Patterns

### Singleton Services
```typescript
// Services initialized once and reused
let instance: ServiceType | null = null

export function getService(): ServiceType {
  if (!instance) {
    instance = new ServiceType(config)
  }
  return instance
}
```

### Environment-Based Configuration
```typescript
// Configuration changes based on environment
const config = {
  development: { verbose: true },
  production: { verbose: false },
  test: { verbose: false }
}[process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development']
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// Consistent error handling across infrastructure
try {
  // Operation
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed', { error, context })
  throw new InfrastructureError('User-friendly message', { cause: error })
}
```

## Integration Guidelines

### Using Core Services

1. **Import from specific paths**
   ```typescript
   import { cache } from '@/lib/core/caching/cache-manager'
   import { logger } from '@/lib/core/monitoring/logger'
   import { rateLimit } from '@/lib/core/security/rate-limit'
   ```

2. **Initialize early**
   - Environment config loads first
   - Logging initializes before other services
   - Cache warms up during startup

3. **Handle errors gracefully**
   - All infrastructure errors extend base error class
   - Errors include context for debugging
   - User-facing errors are sanitized

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Use appropriate cache namespaces
- Set reasonable TTLs
- Implement cache warming
- Monitor cache hit rates

### Logging Performance
- Use appropriate log levels
- Avoid logging sensitive data
- Batch logs when possible
- Rotate logs regularly

### Security Overhead
- Rate limiting adds minimal latency
- Security checks are optimized
- Headers cached where possible
- Validation is fast-path optimized

## Testing Infrastructure

### Unit Tests
Each component includes comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error conditions
- Edge cases
- Performance characteristics

### Integration Tests
Test infrastructure components together:
- Cache with environment config
- Logging with error handling
- Rate limiting with monitoring

### Load Tests
Performance testing for:
- Cache throughput
- Logging impact
- Rate limiter accuracy
- Overall system load

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Health Checks
```typescript
// Each service exposes health status
const health = {
  cache: await cache.health(),
  logger: logger.health(),
  rateLimit: rateLimit.health()
}
```

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging:
```bash
DEBUG=app:* npm run dev
```

### Performance Profiling
```typescript
// Built-in performance tracking
const timer = performance.startTimer('operation')
// ... operation ...
timer.end() // Logs duration
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use infrastructure consistently** - Don't bypass for convenience
2. **Monitor resource usage** - Watch memory and CPU
3. **Test failure scenarios** - Infrastructure must be resilient
4. **Document configuration** - Keep env vars documented
5. **Version carefully** - Infrastructure changes affect everything

## Future Considerations

As the application grows, consider:
- Distributed caching (Redis)
- Centralized logging (ELK stack)
- APM integration (DataDog, New Relic)
- Enhanced security (WAF, DDoS protection)
- Service mesh for microservices
