# Understanding React Server Components

> **Note**: This is a draft article and should not be published to Dev.to

React Server Components (RSC) represent a fundamental shift in how we think about React applications.

## What are Server Components?

Server Components are React components that render on the server and send their output to the client as serialized JSX.

```jsx
// This component runs only on the server
async function BlogPost({ slug }) {
  const post = await db.post.findUnique({ where: { slug } });
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <div>{post.content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Zero Bundle Size**: Server Components don't add to your JavaScript bundle
2. **Direct Backend Access**: Can directly access databases and file systems
3. **Automatic Code Splitting**: Only the code needed for interactivity is sent to the client
