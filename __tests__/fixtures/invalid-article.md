# This Article Has No Title in Front Matter

This is an invalid article because it's missing the required `title` field in the front matter. The Dev.to API requires a title to create or update an article.

## Content

The content itself is valid, but without a proper title in the front matter, this article cannot be published to Dev.to.

```javascript
console.log('This code block is fine');
```

But the missing title makes this fixture useful for testing error handling.
