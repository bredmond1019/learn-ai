# Building AI Agents with TypeScript: A Practical Guide

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to build production-ready AI agents using TypeScript and modern web technologies.

## Introduction

AI agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

## Getting Started

First, let's set up our development environment:

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from 'langchain/llms/openai';
import { AgentExecutor } from 'langchain/agents';

const model = new OpenAI({
  temperature: 0.7,
  modelName: 'gpt-4',
});
```

## Building Your First Agent

Here's a simple example of an AI agent that can answer questions:

```typescript
async function createAgent() {
  const agent = await initializeAgentExecutor(
    tools,
    model,
    'zero-shot-react-description'
  );
  
  return agent;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always implement robust error handling
2. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits
3. **Monitoring**: Track agent performance and costs

## Conclusion

Building AI agents with TypeScript provides type safety and modern tooling that makes development more reliable and maintainable.
