1. **Introduces the concept** using a relatable analogy
2. **Explains the theory** with visual aids (diagrams/flowcharts)
3. **Shows practical examples** with progressively complex code
4. **Compares approaches** (before/after, different methods)
5. **Includes a quiz** testing understanding (5-7 questions)
6. **Provides exercises** for hands-on practice

Structure:
- Introduction: Why this concept matters
- Core Theory: How it works under the hood
- Implementation: Code examples from basic to advanced
- Best Practices: Do's and don'ts
- Real-World Usage: Industry applications
- Practice Exercise: Apply the concept
- Knowledge Check: Quiz on key points
```

### Technical Tutorial Template

```
Create a TUTORIAL module for building [PROJECT/FEATURE] that:

1. **Project Overview**: What we're building and why
2. **Environment Setup**: Required tools and configuration
3. **Step-by-Step Implementation**: 
   - Break into 3-5 major steps
   - Each step has starter code and solution
   - Include validation checkpoints
4. **Testing**: How to verify it works
5. **Enhancement Ideas**: Ways to extend the project

Include:
- Architecture diagram
- File structure overview
- Code snippets for each step
- Common errors and solutions
- Performance considerations
- Deployment notes
```

### Project Module Template

```
Create a PROJECT module for [PROJECT_NAME] that:

1. **Project Requirements**: Clear specifications
2. **Architecture Design**: System design and components
3. **Implementation Phases**:
   - Phase 1: Core functionality
   - Phase 2: Enhanced features
   - Phase 3: Production readiness
4. **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
5. **Deployment Guide**: How to ship to production

Deliverables:
- Complete project structure
- Multiple implementation exercises
- Test cases and validation
- Documentation requirements
- Code review checklist
```

## Content Patterns to Include

### For Beginners
```
- Start with "Why should I care?"
- Use everyday analogies
- Provide extensive code comments
- Include "Try it yourself" prompts
- Celebrate small wins with encouraging callouts
```

### For Intermediate
```
- Focus on best practices
- Compare different approaches
- Include performance considerations
- Show real-world scenarios
- Discuss trade-offs and decision making
```

### For Advanced
```
- Deep dive into internals
- Production-scale considerations
- Advanced patterns and optimizations
- Integration with other systems
- Monitoring and debugging strategies
```

## Interactive Elements Guide

### Quiz Questions
```
Generate quiz questions that:
- Test conceptual understanding (not memorization)
- Use real-world scenarios
- Provide educational explanations
- Mix difficulty levels
- Include code-based questions

Example format:
<Question
  question="In a production MCP server, what's the primary benefit of using a provider registry pattern?"
  options={[
    "It makes the code shorter",
    "It enables dynamic provider registration and better testing",
    "It improves performance",
    "It's required by the MCP specification"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="The provider registry pattern allows for dynamic registration of providers at runtime, making the system more flexible and testable. You can easily mock providers for testing and add new providers without modifying core server code."
/>
```

### Code Examples
```
Structure code examples with:
- Descriptive title explaining the purpose
- Brief comment explaining the approach
- Highlighted lines for important parts
- Progressive complexity (basic ‚Üí advanced)

Example:
<CodeExample
  title="Basic MCP Server with Provider Registry"
  language="typescript"
  code={`
// Initialize the provider registry
const registry = new ProviderRegistry(config, logger);

// Register providers dynamically
await registry.register(new FileSystemProvider());
await registry.register(new DatabaseProvider());
await registry.register(new GitProvider());

// Server automatically uses all registered providers
const resources = await registry.getAllResources();
  `}
  highlightLines={[5, 6, 7]}
/>
```

### Callout Patterns
```
Info Callout (üí° Tips and insights):
<Callout type="info">
  **Pro Tip**: Start with a single provider and gradually add more as you understand the pattern.
</Callout>

Warning Callout (‚ö†Ô∏è Common mistakes):
<Callout type="warning">
  **Watch Out**: Always validate provider health before registration to prevent server startup failures.
</Callout>

Success Callout (‚úÖ Best practices):
<Callout type="success">
  **Best Practice**: Use environment-specific configuration to enable/disable providers based on deployment needs.
</Callout>
```

## Complete Example Request

```
Create a complete learning module for the "agentic-workflows" path:

Title: "Building Multi-Step Agent Workflows"
Duration: 60 minutes
Difficulty: Intermediate
Prerequisites: Basic understanding of agents and MCP

Objectives:
1. Design multi-step workflows for complex tasks
2. Implement error handling and recovery
3. Add human-in-the-loop checkpoints
4. Monitor and debug agent workflows

The module should teach learners how to build agents that can:
- Break down complex goals into steps
- Execute steps in sequence with proper error handling
- Request human input when needed
- Provide progress updates
- Recover from failures gracefully

Include practical examples like:
- Research agent that gathers and summarizes information
- Code review agent with human approval steps
- Data processing pipeline with validation checkpoints
```
