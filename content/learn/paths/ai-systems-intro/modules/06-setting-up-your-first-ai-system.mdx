## introduction {#introduction}

Congratulations on making it this far! You've learned the concepts, understood the benefits, and now it's time to roll up your sleeves and build something real. Don't worry ‚Äì we'll guide you through every step.

In the next few modules, we'll build a practical AI System that can help a small business. By the end, you'll have a working system that you can adapt for your own needs.

<Callout type="info">
**Beginner Friendly**: Even if you've never programmed before, our step-by-step instructions and clear explanations will help you succeed. We'll explain everything as we go!
</Callout>

## what-we-will-build {#what-we-will-build}

### Our Project: Smart Business Assistant

We're going to build an AI System for "Cozy Caf√©" ‚Äì a small coffee shop that needs help with:
- Taking customer feedback
- Answering common questions
- Tracking busy times
- Suggesting daily specials


### Why This Project?

This project is perfect because:
- It solves real business problems
- It's simple enough for beginners
- It demonstrates all key concepts
- You can adapt it for any business

## prerequisites {#prerequisites}

### What You'll Need

Before we start coding, let's make sure you have everything ready. Don't worry if some of this seems new ‚Äì we'll walk through each step.


**Required Software:**
1. **Python** - The programming language we'll use
2. **Code Editor** - Where you'll write code (we recommend VS Code)
3. **Terminal** - For running commands
4. **Internet** - To download packages

<Callout type="tip">
**Time Needed**: Setting up will take about 30-45 minutes. Once done, you won't need to do this again!
</Callout>

## python-setup {#python-setup}

### Step 1: Install Python

Python is like the engine that will run our AI System. Let's get it installed.

#### For Windows Users:

1. Visit [python.org](https://python.org/downloads)
2. Download Python 3.8 or newer
3. Run the installer
4. **Important**: Check "Add Python to PATH"
5. Click "Install Now"

#### For Mac Users:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
# Check if Python is already installed
python3 --version

# If not installed, use Homebrew:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install python3
</CodeBlock>

#### For Linux Users:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# Fedora
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip
</CodeBlock>

### Verify Python Installation

Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and type:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
python --version
# or
python3 --version
</CodeBlock>

You should see something like: `Python 3.9.7`

<Callout type="success">
**Success!** If you see a Python version 3.8 or higher, you're ready for the next step!
</Callout>

## mcp-sdk-installation {#mcp-sdk-installation}

### Step 2: Install the MCP SDK

The MCP SDK is our toolkit for building AI Systems. It's like getting a box of LEGO blocks designed specifically for AI.

<CodeBlock language="bash">
# Install the MCP SDK using pip
pip install mcp

# Or if you need to use pip3
pip3 install mcp
</CodeBlock>

### Understanding pip

`pip` is Python's package manager ‚Äì think of it like an app store for Python tools. When we run `pip install mcp`, it:
1. Downloads the MCP SDK
2. Installs all required dependencies
3. Makes it available in your Python programs

### Install Additional Tools

Let's also install some helpful tools we'll use:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
# Install additional packages
pip install python-dotenv requests

# Verify installations
pip list | grep mcp
</CodeBlock>


## project-structure {#project-structure}

### Step 3: Create Your Project Structure

Now let's create a organized folder structure for our AI System. Good organization makes everything easier!

<CodeBlock language="bash">
# Create project directory
mkdir cozy-cafe-ai
cd cozy-cafe-ai

# Create subdirectories
mkdir mcp_servers
mkdir agents
mkdir data
mkdir config
</CodeBlock>

Your project structure should look like this:

```
cozy-cafe-ai/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp_servers/      # MCP server implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/           # AI agent code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/            # Storage for caf√© data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/          # Configuration files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        # Project documentation
```

### Create Essential Files

Let's create some basic files to get started:

<CodeBlock language="python" filename="config/settings.py">
"""
Configuration settings for Cozy Caf√© AI System
"""

# Caf√© Information
CAFE_NAME = "Cozy Caf√©"
OPENING_HOURS = "7:00 AM - 8:00 PM"
LOCATION = "123 Main Street"

# System Settings
DEBUG_MODE = True
LOG_LEVEL = "INFO"

# MCP Server Ports
FEEDBACK_SERVER_PORT = 5000
ANALYTICS_SERVER_PORT = 5001
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock language="python" filename="requirements.txt">
mcp>=0.1.0
python-dotenv>=0.19.0
requests>=2.26.0
</CodeBlock>

<Callout type="info">
**What are these files?**
- `settings.py`: Stores configuration that we can easily change
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the packages our project needs
</Callout>

## verify-setup {#verify-setup}

### Step 4: Verify Your Setup

Let's make sure everything is working correctly before we start building.

Create a test file to verify our setup:

<CodeBlock language="python" filename="test_setup.py">
"""
Test script to verify our development environment
"""

print("üîç Checking Python setup...")

# Test Python version
import sys
python_version = sys.version.split()[0]
print(f"‚úì Python version: {python_version}")

# Test MCP import
try:
    import mcp
    print("‚úì MCP SDK installed successfully")
except ImportError:
    print("‚úó MCP SDK not found - please run: pip install mcp")

# Test other imports
try:
    import dotenv
    print("‚úì python-dotenv installed")
except ImportError:
    print("‚úó python-dotenv not found")

try:
    import requests
    print("‚úì requests library installed")
except ImportError:
    print("‚úó requests not found")

# Test file structure
import os
directories = ['mcp_servers', 'agents', 'data', 'config']
for directory in directories:
    if os.path.exists(directory):
        print(f"‚úì Directory '{directory}' exists")
    else:
        print(f"‚úó Directory '{directory}' not found")

print("\nüéâ Setup verification complete!")
</CodeBlock>

Run the test:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
python test_setup.py
</CodeBlock>

You should see all green checkmarks (‚úì). If you see any red X marks, follow the suggestion to fix the issue.
