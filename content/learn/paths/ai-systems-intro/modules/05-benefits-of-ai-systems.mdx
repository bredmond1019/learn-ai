Let's make this concrete. Here's how to calculate the real ROI of implementing an AI System in your business.


### Simple ROI Formula

**Monthly Savings = Time Saved × Hourly Rate + Cost Reductions**

Example for a Small Business:
- Time Saved: 40 hours/month × $25/hour = $1,000
- Reduced Errors: $500/month
- Avoided New Hire: $3,000/month
- **Total Monthly Benefit: $4,500**

AI System Cost: $500/month
**Net Benefit: $4,000/month ($48,000/year)**

<Callout type="info">
**Quick Check**: If an AI System saves you just 2 hours per day, it typically pays for itself within the first month.
