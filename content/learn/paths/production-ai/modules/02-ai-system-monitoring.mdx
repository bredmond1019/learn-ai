## Logging Strategies for AI {#logging-strategies}

### Structured Logging Best Practices

#### Log Schema Design
Design logs that capture the full context of AI operations:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T10:23:45.123Z",
  "request_id": "req-abc123",
  "model": {
    "name": "recommendation-engine",
    "version": "v2.3.1",
    "variant": "personalized"
  },
  "inference": {
    "duration_ms": 145.3,
    "confidence": 0.923,
    "prediction": "product_123",
    "features_used": ["user_history", "item_popularity", "context_time"]
  },
  "resources": {
    "tokens": {"prompt": 150, "completion": 50},
    "gpu_time_ms": 89.2,
    "memory_mb": 512
  },
  "metadata": {
    "user_segment": "premium",
    "experiment": "new_algorithm_test",
    "region": "us-west-2"
  }
}
```

#### Privacy-Preserving Logging

<Callout type="warning">
**Privacy First**: Never log sensitive user data or PII. Use hashing, tokenization, or aggregation to maintain privacy while enabling debugging.
</Callout>

Strategies for privacy-preserving logs:
- **Input hashing**: Store hashes instead of raw inputs
- **Differential privacy**: Add noise to aggregated metrics
- **Data minimization**: Log only necessary information
- **Retention policies**: Delete logs after specified periods

### Log Aggregation and Analysis

#### Centralized Logging Architecture
- **Log collectors**: Fluentd, Logstash, Vector
- **Storage backends**: Elasticsearch, CloudWatch, BigQuery
- **Analysis tools**: Kibana, Grafana Loki, Datadog

#### Log Patterns for AI Systems

##### Inference Logs
```python
logger.info("inference_complete", extra={
    "request_id": request_id,
    "model_name": model_name,
    "model_version": model_version,
    "prediction": prediction,
    "confidence": confidence,
    "latency_ms": latency,
    "feature_vector_hash": hash_features(features)
})
```

##### Error and Exception Logs
```python
logger.error("inference_failed", extra={
    "request_id": request_id,
    "error_type": type(e).__name__,
    "error_message": str(e),
    "model_name": model_name,
    "retry_count": retry_count,
    "fallback_used": fallback_model is not None
})
```

##### Model Event Logs
```python
logger.info("model_loaded", extra={
    "model_name": model_name,
    "model_version": model_version,
    "load_time_ms": load_time,
    "model_size_mb": model_size,
    "device": "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
})
```

### Debugging with Logs

#### Correlation and Tracing

#### Dashboard Configuration Example

```yaml
# Grafana Dashboard Configuration
panels:
  - title: "Model Inference Latency"
    type: graph
    targets:
      - expr: |
          histogram_quantile(0.95,
            sum(rate(ai_inference_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) 
            by (le, model, version)
          )
    gridPos: {x: 0, y: 0, w: 12, h: 8}
    
  - title: "Prediction Confidence Heatmap"
    type: heatmap
    targets:
      - expr: "sum(rate(ai_prediction_confidence_bucket[5m])) by (le)"
    gridPos: {x: 12, y: 0, w: 12, h: 8}
    
  - title: "Model Drift Score"
    type: gauge
    targets:
      - expr: "ai_model_drift_score"
    thresholds:
      - value: 0.3
        color: yellow
      - value: 0.7
        color: red
    gridPos: {x: 0, y: 8, w: 6, h: 6}
```

## Alert Strategies and Thresholds {#alerting-strategies}

### Alert Design Philosophy

#### Alert Quality Over Quantity
- **Actionable alerts**: Every alert should have a clear response
- **Avoid alert fatigue**: Minimize false positives
- **Severity levels**: Critical, Warning, Info
- **Smart grouping**: Related alerts bundled together

### Types of AI System Alerts

#### Performance Alerts
```yaml
- alert: HighInferenceLatency
  expr: |
    histogram_quantile(0.95, 
      rate(ai_inference_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])
    ) > 1.0
  for: 5m
  severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "Model inference taking >1s at P95"
    runbook_url: "https://wiki/runbooks/ai-latency"
```

#### Model Quality Alerts
```yaml
- alert: ModelAccuracyDegraded
  expr: ai_model_accuracy < 0.85
  for: 30m
  severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "Model accuracy below 85% threshold"
    action: "Consider model rollback or retraining"
```

#### Resource Alerts
```yaml
- alert: HighTokenUsage
  expr: |
    sum(rate(ai_token_usage_total[1h])) > 100000
  for: 5m
  severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "Token usage exceeding budget"
    dashboard: "http://grafana/d/token-usage"
```

### Alert Routing and Escalation

#### Routing Strategy
```yaml
route:
  group_by: ['alertname', 'model', 'severity']
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 12h
  receiver: 'ai-team'
  routes:
    - match:
        severity: critical
      receiver: 'pagerduty'
    - match:
        team: data-science
      receiver: 'ds-team'
    - match:
        severity: warning
      receiver: 'slack'
```

#### Escalation Policies
1. **Immediate response**: Critical production issues
2. **Business hours**: Non-critical performance degradation
3. **Daily review**: Trend-based alerts
4. **Weekly summary**: Low-priority notifications

### Alert Tuning and Optimization

#### Reducing False Positives
- **Time-based conditions**: Require sustained issues
- **Business hour awareness**: Different thresholds for peak times
- **Seasonal adjustments**: Account for known patterns
- **Dynamic thresholds**: Adapt based on historical data

#### Alert Testing
```python
# Alert testing framework
def test_alert_conditions():
    """Test alert rules against historical data"""
    
    # Load historical metrics
    metrics = load_metrics(days=30)
    
    # Simulate alert conditions
    alerts = evaluate_rules(metrics, alert_rules)
    
    # Calculate metrics
    false_positive_rate = calculate_false_positives(alerts, incidents)
    alert_coverage = calculate_incident_coverage(alerts, incidents)
    
    assert false_positive_rate < 0.05  # Less than 5% false positives
    assert alert_coverage > 0.95  # Catch 95% of real incidents
```
