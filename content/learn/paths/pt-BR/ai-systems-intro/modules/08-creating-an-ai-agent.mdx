## introduction {#introduction}

Now comes the exciting part ‚Äì creating an AI agent that can think, understand, and take action! This agent will be the friendly face of Cozy Caf√©, helping customers and providing insights to the owner.

Your AI agent will:
- Understand natural language questions
- Use the MCP feedback server to collect and analyze feedback
- Provide helpful responses to customers
- Generate insights for the caf√© owner

<Callout type="success">
**Real AI in Action**: By the end of this module, you'll have a working AI assistant that can have intelligent conversations and perform real tasks!
</Callout>

### The Anatomy of an AI Agent

An AI agent combines intelligence (LLM) with capabilities (MCP servers) to accomplish tasks. Think of it as a smart employee who can understand instructions and use various tools.


### Key Agent Capabilities

1. **Natural Language Understanding** - Interprets what users really want
2. **Context Awareness** - Remembers conversation history
3. **Tool Usage** - Knows when and how to use MCP servers
4. **Response Generation** - Creates helpful, friendly responses

### Designing Cozy Caf√© Assistant

Let's design our caf√© assistant with specific personality and capabilities:


### Agent Behaviors

**For Customers:**
- Warm greeting and friendly conversation
- Easy feedback collection
- Answer questions about menu, hours, etc.
- Thank customers genuinely

**For Caf√© Owner:**
- Summarize feedback trends
- Alert about issues
- Suggest improvements
- Provide business insights

  questions={[
    {
      question: "What is the main role of an AI agent in our system?",
      options: [
        "To store data in files",
        "To understand user intent and coordinate actions using available tools",
        "To replace the MCP server",
        "To create websites"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "AI agents understand what users want (using LLM intelligence) and coordinate actions by calling appropriate tools through MCP servers."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the agent connect to MCP servers?",
      options: [
        "Through direct database connections",
        "Using the MCP Client with stdio communication",
        "Via HTTP REST APIs only",
        "Through file system access"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The agent uses an MCP Client that communicates with servers through stdio (standard input/output), following the Model Context Protocol."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes our agent 'intelligent'?",
      options: [
        "It has a large database",
        "It uses an LLM to understand context and generate appropriate responses",
        "It runs very fast",
        "It has many if-else statements"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The agent's intelligence comes from using an LLM (Large Language Model) to understand user intent, maintain context, and generate natural responses."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of the conversation manager?",
      options: [
        "To save conversations to disk",
        "To limit conversation length",
        "To handle the interactive flow and coordinate between user, agent, and tools",
        "To translate languages"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The conversation manager handles the interactive flow, maintaining the conversation loop, and coordinating between user input, agent processing, and tool execution."
