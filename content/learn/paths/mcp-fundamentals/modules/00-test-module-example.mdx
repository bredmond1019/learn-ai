# Example Section

This section demonstrates how code examples are integrated into the learning platform.

## JavaScript Example

Here's a simple JavaScript example:

```javascript
// Hello World in JavaScript
console.log('Hello, World!');

// Function example
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Usage
const message = greet('Learning Platform');
console.log(message);
```

## Key Features

Our learning platform supports:

1. **Syntax Highlighting** - Code blocks are automatically highlighted
2. **Multiple Languages** - Support for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more
3. **Interactive Examples** - Some examples can be run directly
4. **Explanations** - Each code example includes detailed explanations

## Try It Yourself

The code example above demonstrates basic JavaScript concepts. In a real learning module, you would have interactive exercises to practice these concepts.

## Next Steps

After completing this example section, you can move on to the exercises and quiz to test your understanding.
