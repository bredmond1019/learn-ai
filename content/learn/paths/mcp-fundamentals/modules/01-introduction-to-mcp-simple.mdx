# What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that enables AI applications to connect with external data sources and tools.

## Core Concepts

MCP servers act as bridges between AI models and your systems:

- **Resources**: Expose data that AI can read
- **Tools**: Enable AI to perform actions
- **Prompts**: Provide reusable prompt templates

## Why MCP?

1. **Standardization**: One protocol for all integrations
2. **Security**: Built-in permission model
3. **Flexibility**: Works with any AI application
4. **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and maintain

## Getting Started

In the next module, we'll set up your development environment and create your first MCP server.
