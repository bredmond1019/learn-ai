# Introduction to Test Module

Welcome to the test module! This module is designed to validate our learning system implementation.

## What You'll Learn

In this test module, you will:

- Understand how modules are structured
- See how TypeScript interfaces work
- Test the system functionality

## Getting Started

This is a simple introduction to demonstrate how MDX content is parsed and displayed within our learning platform.

The system supports:

- **Markdown formatting** like bold and italic text
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Lists and structured content
- Custom components (when needed)

Let's move on to the next section to see some examples!
