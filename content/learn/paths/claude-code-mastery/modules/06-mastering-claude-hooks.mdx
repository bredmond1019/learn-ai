# Mastering Claude Hooks

## Introduction {#introduction}

Picture this: It's 6 AM, you're in the flow with Claude Code, and suddenly your AI assistant decides that "the best code is no code" and starts deleting your entire codebase with `rm -rf` commands. Sound terrifying? This exact scenario is what Claude hooks were designed to prevent.

Claude hooks transform your AI coding assistant from a reactive tool into a proactive development partner that:
- Automatically runs tests and formatters
- Blocks dangerous operations before they execute
- Provides voice notifications for long-running tasks
- Generates comprehensive logs for debugging
- Coordinates parallel agent workflows

<Callout type="info">
  **Key Insight**: As IndyDevDan puts it: "As we push into the age of agents, we need observability to scale our impact." Hooks provide the observability and control necessary for truly agentic engineering.
</Callout>

### Why Hooks Matter

Traditional AI assistants write code, but then leave you to handle all the housekeeping:
- Running linters and formatters
- Executing test suites
- Checking for type errors
- Monitoring what the AI actually did
- Preventing dangerous operations

Hooks automate all of this and more, letting you focus on solving problems instead of babysitting your AI.

## Understanding Hook Events {#hook-events}

Claude Code provides five powerful hook events that fire at specific points in the AI's lifecycle:

### 1. PreToolUse - Your Safety Guardian

This hook fires **before** any tool runs, giving you the power to inspect and potentially block operations.

<CodeExample
  title="Basic PreToolUse Hook"
  language="json"
  code={`{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": ".*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python scripts/check_safety.py"
      }]
    }]
  }
}`}
/>

**Common Use Cases:**
- Block dangerous commands (`rm -rf`, `sudo`, etc.)
- Require approval for sensitive operations
- Validate inputs before execution
- Set up environment prerequisites

### 2. PostToolUse - The Observer

Fires **after** a tool completes, perfect for logging and monitoring.

<CodeExample
  title="Logging with PostToolUse"
  language="json"
  code={`{
  "PostToolUse": [{
    "matcher": "Edit|Write",
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": "uv run scripts/log_changes.py"
    }]
  }]
}`}
/>

**Common Use Cases:**
- Log all file modifications
- Track tool execution times
- Generate audit trails
- Trigger follow-up actions

### 3. Notification - Interactive Moments

Triggers when Claude needs your input or wants to notify you of something important.

<CodeExample
  title="Voice Notification Hook"
  language="json"
  code={`{
  "Notification": [{
    "matcher": ".*",
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": "echo 'Claude needs your attention' | say"
    }]
  }]
}`}
/>

### 4. Stop - Session Complete

Executes when Claude finishes responding, ideal for cleanup and final actions.

<CodeExample
  title="Save Chat Log on Stop"
  language="json"
  code={`{
  "Stop": [{
    "matcher": ".*",
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": "python scripts/save_chat.py --format json"
    }]
  }]
}`}
/>

### 5. SubagentStop - Parallel Processing

Fires when sub-agents complete their tasks in parallel workflows.

<Callout type="success">
  **Pro Tip**: Use SubagentStop hooks to get individual notifications as parallel tasks complete, perfect for long-running operations where you want progress updates.
</Callout>

## Implementing Safety Controls {#safety-controls}

One of the most critical uses of hooks is preventing disasters before they happen. Let's build a comprehensive safety system.

### Basic Command Blocking

Start with a simple Python script that checks for dangerous commands:

<CodeExample
  title="scripts/safety_check.py"
  language="python"
  code={`#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import sys
import json

DANGEROUS_COMMANDS = [
    'rm -rf',
    'sudo rm',
    'format',
    'dd if=',
    ':(){:|:&};:',  # Fork bomb
]

def check_command_safety():
    tool_name = os.environ.get('TOOL_NAME', '')
    command = os.environ.get('TOOL_COMMAND', '')
    
    if tool_name != 'Bash':
        return True
    
    for danger in DANGEROUS_COMMANDS:
        if danger in command:
            print(f"BLOCKED: Dangerous command detected: {danger}")
            sys.exit(1)
    
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_command_safety()`}
/>

### Advanced Safety with Allowlists

For production environments, use an allowlist approach:

<CodeExample
  title="Advanced Safety Configuration"
  language="python"
  code={`ALLOWED_PATTERNS = {
    'npm': ['install', 'run', 'test', 'build'],
    'git': ['status', 'diff', 'log', 'add', 'commit'],
    'python': ['*.py', '-m pytest'],
    'cargo': ['build', 'test', 'run', 'fmt'],
}

def validate_against_allowlist(command):
    parts = command.split()
    if not parts:
        return False
    
    base_cmd = parts[0]
    if base_cmd not in ALLOWED_PATTERNS:
        return needs_approval(command)
    
    # Check if command matches allowed patterns
    allowed = ALLOWED_PATTERNS[base_cmd]
    return any(pattern_matches(command, pattern) 
               for pattern in allowed)`}
/>

## Building Observability {#observability}

Observability is crucial for understanding and improving your agent's behavior. Let's build a comprehensive logging system.

### Structured Logging

Create detailed, structured logs that capture everything your agent does:

<CodeExample
  title="Comprehensive Logging System"
  language="python"
  code={`import json
import time
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path

class HookLogger:
    def __init__(self, log_dir="logs"):
        self.log_dir = Path(log_dir)
        self.log_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
        
    def log_tool_use(self):
        entry = {
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "event": "tool_use",
            "tool": os.environ.get("TOOL_NAME"),
            "file_path": os.environ.get("TOOL_FILE_PATH"),
            "pattern": os.environ.get("TOOL_PATTERN"),
            "command": os.environ.get("TOOL_COMMAND"),
            "duration_ms": None,
        }
        
        log_file = self.log_dir / "post-tool-use.json"
        self._append_log(log_file, entry)
    
    def log_chat_complete(self):
        # Capture entire conversation
        chat_data = self._get_chat_context()
        
        log_file = self.log_dir / "chat.json"
        with open(log_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(chat_data, f, indent=2)`}
/>

### Analyzing Agent Behavior

Use the logs to understand patterns and optimize workflows:

<CodeExample
  title="Log Analysis Script"
  language="python"
  code={`def analyze_tool_usage(log_file):
    with open(log_file) as f:
        logs = [json.loads(line) for line in f]
    
    # Find most used tools
    tool_counts = {}
    for entry in logs:
        tool = entry.get('tool', 'unknown')
        tool_counts[tool] = tool_counts.get(tool, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate average execution times
    # Identify error patterns
    # Track file modification frequency
    
    return {
        'total_operations': len(logs),
        'tool_usage': tool_counts,
        'files_modified': len(set(e['file_path'] for e in logs if e.get('file_path')))
    }`}
/>

## Advanced Hook Patterns {#advanced-patterns}

### Voice-Enabled Development

Transform your development experience with audio feedback:

<CodeExample
  title="Complete Voice Integration"
  language="python"
  code={`# scripts/voice_assistant.py
import pyttsx3
import os

class VoiceAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = pyttsx3.init()
        self.engine.setProperty('rate', 180)
        
    def notify_complete(self):
        task_type = os.environ.get('TASK_TYPE', 'Task')
        self.speak(f"{task_type} complete. Ready for next step.")
    
    def alert_error(self, error_msg):
        self.speak(f"Error detected: {error_msg}")
    
    def progress_update(self, current, total):
        self.speak(f"Progress: {current} of {total} complete")`}
/>

### Parallel Agent Coordination

Handle multiple agents working simultaneously:

<CodeExample
  title="Parallel Agent Monitoring"
  language="json"
  code={`{
  "SubagentStop": [{
    "matcher": ".*",
    "hooks": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python scripts/track_agent.py --notify"
      },
      {
        "type": "command", 
        "command": "python scripts/update_dashboard.py"
      }
    ]
  }]
}`}
/>

### Integration with External Tools

Connect Claude to your existing development ecosystem:

<CodeExample
  title="Slack Integration"
  language="python"
  code={`import requests

def notify_slack(message, channel="#dev-notifications"):
    webhook_url = os.environ.get('SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL')
    
    payload = {
        "channel": channel,
        "text": message,
        "username": "Claude Code",
        "icon_emoji": ":robot_face:"
    }
    
    requests.post(webhook_url, json=payload)`}
/>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Security Note**: Never hardcode webhook URLs or API keys. Always use environment variables and keep sensitive data out of your hook scripts.
</Callout>

## Practice Exercise {#practice-exercise}

Let's put it all together by building a complete hook configuration for a production environment.

### Exercise: Build Your Safety Net

Create a comprehensive hook setup that:

1. **Prevents disasters** with PreToolUse safety checks
2. **Logs everything** with PostToolUse monitoring
3. **Notifies on completion** with voice alerts
4. **Saves chat context** for analysis
5. **Handles parallel agents** gracefully

<CodeExample
  title="Complete Hook Configuration"
  language="json"
  code={`{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": ".*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "uv run scripts/safety_guard.py"
      }]
    }],
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": ".*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "uv run scripts/logger.py --event post-tool"
      }]
    }],
    "Notification": [{
      "matcher": ".*", 
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "uv run scripts/voice.py --notify"
      }]
    }],
    "Stop": [{
      "matcher": ".*",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "uv run scripts/logger.py --save-chat"
        },
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "echo 'Session complete' | say"
        }
      ]
    }],
    "SubagentStop": [{
      "matcher": ".*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "uv run scripts/agent_tracker.py"
      }]
    }]
  }
}`}
/>

### Challenge Tasks

1. **Add Custom Matchers**: Instead of `".*"`, create specific matchers for different file types
2. **Build a Dashboard**: Create a real-time dashboard that visualizes your agent's activity
3. **Implement Rollback**: Add a hook that can automatically rollback changes if tests fail
4. **Create Team Notifications**: Build hooks that notify your team channel when important milestones are reached

## Summary

Claude hooks represent a fundamental shift in how we work with AI coding assistants. By implementing proper hooks, you gain:

- **Safety**: Prevent disasters before they happen
- **Observability**: Understand exactly what your agent is doing
- **Automation**: Eliminate repetitive manual tasks
- **Awareness**: Stay informed with voice and visual notifications
- **Control**: Fine-grained control over agent behavior

Remember: The goal isn't to constrain your AI assistant, but to enhance it with the context and guardrails that make it a truly effective development partner.
