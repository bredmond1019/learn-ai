# Claude Code Integrations

Claude Code offers three primary integration methods, each designed to meet you where you work. In this module, we'll master the terminal integration, IDE enhancement, and GitHub collaboration features.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- Set up and use Claude Code in any terminal environment
- Integrate Claude Code with your favorite IDE
- Connect Claude Code to GitHub repositories
- Choose the right integration method for different tasks

## Terminal Integration: The Foundation

The terminal integration is Claude Code's most fundamental offering—it works anywhere you have a command line.

### Installation and Setup

<CodeExample language="bash">
# Install globally via npm
npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code

# Or use other package managers
brew install claude-code  # macOS
apt install claude-code   # Ubuntu (coming soon)

# Verify installation
claude --version
</CodeExample>

### Universal Compatibility

Claude Code works in any terminal environment:

<CodeExample language="bash">
# Native terminals
- Terminal.app (macOS)
- iTerm2
- Windows Terminal
- GNOME Terminal

# Terminal multiplexers
$ tmux new -s coding
$ claude "explain tmux pane management"

# Over SSH
$ ssh dev-server
$ claude "analyze system performance"

# Inside IDE terminals
# VS Code: Ctrl+` (backtick)
# IntelliJ: Alt+F12
# Cursor: Same as VS Code
$ claude "refactor the selected code"
</CodeExample>

### Core Terminal Commands

<CodeExample language="bash">
# Basic usage
$ claude "your request here"

# Pipe mode (-p flag)
$ echo "function broken() { return null }" | claude -p "fix this function"

# File context
$ claude "explain main.py"  # Claude automatically reads the file

# Multiple files
$ claude "how do auth.py and database.py interact?"

# Directory context
$ claude "summarize the src/ directory structure"
</CodeExample>

### Advanced Terminal Features

<Callout type="power-tip">
Claude Code follows Unix philosophy—it's a well-behaved citizen in the command-line ecosystem.
</Callout>

<CodeExample language="bash">
# Combine with Unix tools
$ find . -name "*.test.js" | claude -p "list all test files that need updates"

# Use in scripts
#!/bin/bash
ERROR_LOG=$(tail -100 /var/log/app.log | grep ERROR)
echo "$ERROR_LOG" | claude -p "diagnose these errors and suggest fixes"

# Background processing
$ claude "refactor all Python files for PEP 8 compliance" &
$ jobs  # Check progress

# Output redirection
$ claude "generate API documentation" > api-docs.md
$ claude "create unit tests for user.py" >> test_user.py
</CodeExample>

## IDE Integration: Enhanced Experience

When you run Claude Code inside an IDE's terminal, it detects the environment and provides enhanced features.

### Supported IDEs

- **VS Code**: Full integration with diff view
- **Cursor**: Works in terminal with enhanced features
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Terminal integration
- **Sublime Text**: Terminal integration
- **Vim/Neovim**: Terminal integration + plugins available

### IDE-Specific Features

<CodeExample language="bash">
# In VS Code terminal
$ claude "refactor this function for better performance"
# Result: Opens a diff view showing proposed changes

# Automatic context detection
$ claude "fix the error on line 42"
# Claude reads the active file and diagnostics

# Multi-file operations
$ claude "update all imports after moving utils.py to lib/"
# Changes appear in IDE's diff viewer
</CodeExample>

### VS Code Deep Integration

<CodeExample language="javascript">
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx": "bash",
  "terminal.integrated.env.osx": {
    "CLAUDE_EDITOR": "code"
  },
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/.claude-cache/**": true
  }
}
</CodeExample>

### IDE Workflows

<CodeExample language="bash">
# Morning standup helper
$ claude "check git log and tell me what I worked on yesterday"

# Code review assistant
$ claude "review the changes in this PR and suggest improvements"

# Debugging partner
$ claude "I have a null pointer exception at line 89, help me trace the issue"

# Documentation generator
$ claude "generate JSDoc comments for all exported functions"
</CodeExample>

## GitHub Integration: Repository-Wide Intelligence

The GitHub integration lets Claude work with any repository without cloning it locally.

### Setting Up GitHub Integration

<CodeExample language="bash">
# In Claude chat (not terminal)
/install-github-app

# Follow the prompts:
# 1. Authenticate with GitHub
# 2. Select repositories to grant access
# 3. Claude can now read those repos

# Privacy note: Your code stays on YOUR infrastructure
# Claude only reads what you explicitly share
</CodeExample>

### Using GitHub Integration

Once connected, you can reference repositories naturally:

<CodeExample language="text">
# In Claude chat
"Look at github.com/myorg/myrepo and explain the authentication flow"

"Review the recent PRs in github.com/myorg/myrepo for security issues"

"Generate comprehensive tests for the API routes in github.com/myorg/backend"
</CodeExample>

### GitHub Workflow Examples

<Callout type="workflow">
The GitHub integration is perfect for:
- Code reviews without local setup
- Analyzing unfamiliar codebases
- Cross-repository refactoring
- Generating documentation for team repos
</Callout>

<CodeExample language="bash">
# Architecture analysis
"Analyze the architecture of github.com/facebook/react and create a diagram"

# Security audit
"Check github.com/mycompany/api for common security vulnerabilities"

# Dependency analysis
"List all dependencies in github.com/myproject/backend and flag outdated ones"

# Cross-repo refactoring
"Show me all repos that import the deprecated API from github.com/mycompany/legacy"
</CodeExample>

## Choosing the Right Integration

### Decision Matrix

| Use Case | Best Integration | Why |
|----------|-----------------|-----|
| Quick code questions | Terminal | Fast, no context switch |
| Active development | IDE Terminal | Enhanced diffs, diagnostics |
| Code review | GitHub | No local setup needed |
| Automation/Scripts | Terminal | Composable, scriptable |
| Learning new codebase | GitHub | Browse without cloning |
| Pair programming | IDE Terminal | Real-time, contextual |

### Integration Combinations

You can use multiple integrations together:

<CodeExample language="bash">
# Morning workflow
# 1. GitHub: Check overnight PRs
"Review PRs submitted to github.com/myteam/project overnight"

# 2. Terminal: Update local environment
$ claude "check my local environment and update dependencies"

# 3. IDE: Start coding
$ code .
$ claude "implement the user story JIRA-1234"
</CodeExample>

## Practical Exercise: Multi-Integration Workflow

Let's build a complete workflow using all three integrations:

### Scenario: New Feature Development

You're tasked with adding a caching layer to an existing API.

<CodeExample language="bash">
# Part 1: Research (GitHub Integration)
# In Claude chat:
"Analyze github.com/myteam/api and suggest where to add caching"

# Part 2: Local Setup (Terminal Integration)
$ git clone git@github.com:myteam/api.git
$ cd api
$ claude "check this project's setup requirements and help me install dependencies"

# Part 3: Implementation (IDE Integration)
$ code .  # Open in VS Code
$ claude "implement Redis caching for the /users endpoint"
# See diffs in VS Code

# Part 4: Testing (Terminal Integration)
$ claude "write comprehensive tests for the new caching layer"
$ npm test

# Part 5: Documentation (Mixed)
$ claude "update README.md with caching configuration instructions"
$ claude "generate API documentation for the cached endpoints" > docs/caching.md

# Part 6: Review (GitHub Integration)
# After pushing:
"Review my PR at github.com/myteam/api/pull/123 for best practices"
</CodeExample>

### Exercise Tasks

1. **Terminal Mastery**: Create a bash alias that uses Claude Code to analyze code complexity:
   ```bash
   alias complexity='find . -name "*.js" | xargs wc -l | sort -nr | head -20 | claude -p "analyze complexity"'
   ```

2. **IDE Enhancement**: Configure your IDE to use Claude Code for specific tasks (linting, formatting, etc.)

3. **GitHub Workflow**: Use the GitHub integration to analyze a popular open-source project and create an architecture document

4. **Integration Chain**: Build a script that:
   - Uses GitHub integration to check for new issues
   - Uses terminal integration to create branch
   - Uses IDE integration to implement fixes

## Best Practices

### Terminal Integration
- Use `-p` flag for piping to maintain Unix philosophy
- Create aliases for common operations
- Combine with existing tools (grep, find, awk)
- Use in git hooks for automated checks

### IDE Integration
- Keep Claude terminal open in a dedicated pane
- Use for real-time code review while typing
- Leverage diagnostics integration
- Create keyboard shortcuts for common Claude commands

### GitHub Integration
- Perfect for unfamiliar codebases
- Use for architecture documentation
- Great for security audits
- Ideal for cross-team code reviews

## Key Takeaways

1. **Terminal is Universal** - Works everywhere, scriptable, composable
2. **IDE Enhances Experience** - Better visualization, contextual awareness
3. **GitHub Enables Scale** - Analyze any repo without local setup
4. **Combine for Power** - Use all three based on the task at hand
