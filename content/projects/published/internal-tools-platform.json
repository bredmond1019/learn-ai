  "title": "Internal Tools Platform - From Zero to Team Lead",
  "description": "Built and led the development of a comprehensive internal automation platform that grew from a solo project to a 5-person team, automating 80% of manual processes and saving 1000+ hours monthly.",
  "longDescription": "Spearheaded the creation of an enterprise-wide internal tools platform that fundamentally transformed how the organization handles operational workflows. What started as a personal automation project quickly evolved into a critical business system that now supports hundreds of employees across multiple departments.\n\nThis platform demonstrates end-to-end systems thinking, from identifying pain points to architecting scalable solutions and leading a growing team. The system integrates with over 20 internal services, automates complex multi-step workflows, and provides real-time dashboards for operational insights.\n\nThe success of this project led to the formation of a dedicated Internal Tools team, which I now lead. The platform has become the backbone of operational efficiency, handling everything from employee onboarding to complex data processing pipelines.",
