  "description": "High-performance workflow orchestration engine built in Rust with MCP server integration for seamless AI agent communication, processing 50,000+ jobs/hour with sub-millisecond latency.",
  "longDescription": "Designed and implemented a production-grade workflow engine in Rust that revolutionizes how AI agents communicate and orchestrate complex tasks. The system integrates cutting-edge Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to enable seamless communication between different AI systems and tools.\n\nThis engine serves as the backbone for agentic workflows, handling everything from simple task automation to complex multi-agent orchestration. Built with performance and reliability in mind, it leverages Rust's memory safety and concurrency features to achieve exceptional throughput while maintaining strict reliability guarantees.\n\nThe MCP integration allows for dynamic tool discovery and execution, enabling AI agents to seamlessly interact with databases, APIs, file systems, and other resources through standardized protocol interfaces.",
