What you're about to see is simple and powerful.

Running a single Claude Code agent is just the beginning. Once you realize this and start scaling up the number of agents you have shipping for you, you quickly run into a massive problem.

There's too much to keep track of.

When it comes to multi-agent systems, observability is everything. With Claude Code hooks sending events to a minimal client-server architecture, you can see everything.

Let's break down a concrete approach to Claude Code multi-agent observability that lets you scale up what you can do with not just one Claude Code instance, but 3, 5, 10, and beyond.

## The Problem: Too Many Agents, Too Little Visibility ðŸ‘€

Imagine this scenario: You have multiple agents running simultaneously:
- One agent refactoring your authentication system
- Another generating API documentation
- A third running integration tests
- Two more doing deep research on different parts of your codebase

Without observability, you're flying blind. Which agent needs your input? What are they actually doing? When something goes wrong, how do you trace it back?

## The Solution: Real-Time Multi-Agent Observability ðŸŽ¯

Here's what we're building: A complete observability system that lets you monitor all your agents in real-time.

### Key Features:
- **Live Activity Pulse**: Visual representation of all agent activities
- **Event Stream**: Every tool call, hook, and decision
- **AI-Powered Summaries**: Understand at a glance what each agent is doing
- **Session Tracking**: Color-coded agents for easy identification

## Getting Started ðŸš€

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic event logging to a file
2. **Add Real-Time**: Implement WebSocket broadcasting
3. **Build the Dashboard**: Start with a simple event list, add visualizations
4. **Scale Gradually**: Add more agents as your observability improves

Remember: If you don't measure it, you can't improve it. If you don't monitor it, how will you know what's actually happening?

The future of engineering is multi-agent systems. The key to multi-agent systems is observability. Build it once, scale it forever.

Your agents are working hard. It's time you could see everything they do.
