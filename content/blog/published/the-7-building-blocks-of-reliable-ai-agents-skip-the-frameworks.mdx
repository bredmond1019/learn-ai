If you're a developer, then right now it feels almost impossible to keep up with everything that's going on within the AI space.

Your LinkedIn feed is full of "I built an AI agent that made me $50K in 2 hours!" Your Twitter is drowning in new frameworks. Every week there's a new Fireship video making you question if you're already obsolete.

And yet, you're still debugging that LangChain error, wondering if you should switch to LlamaIndex, while your "agentic" system hallucinates its way through production.

Here's what nobody's telling you: **The teams actually shipping reliable AI systems to production are ignoring 99% of the noise.**

Dave Ebbelaar gets it. With over 10 years in AI and 20+ production deployments under his belt, he's seen the pattern. The best AI engineers aren't using complex frameworks. They're using 7 simple building blocks that you can implement in any language.

And here's the controversial part: The most effective AI agents aren't actually that agentic at all.

## The $10,000 Reality Check 💸

Let's start with a truth bomb: Making an LLM API call right now is the most expensive and dangerous operation in software engineering.

Think about it:
- **Cost**: $0.01-0.10 per call (adds up fast)
- **Latency**: 1-5 seconds (eternity in computing)
- **Reliability**: Probabilistic (different outputs for same input)
- **Safety**: Can hallucinate, leak data, or make things up

Yet most tutorials tell you to give your LLM 15 tools and let it figure everything out. That's like giving a toddler a chainsaw and hoping for the best.

<Callout type="warning">
**The Framework Trap**: Every abstraction layer between you and the LLM API is another point of failure, another dependency to manage, and another thing that can break when OpenAI updates their API.
</Callout>

## The Two Types of AI Systems (And Why It Matters) 🎭

Before we dive into the building blocks, you need to understand this critical distinction:

### Type 1: AI Assistants (Human-in-the-Loop)
- Examples: ChatGPT, Cursor, GitHub Copilot
- Multiple LLM calls make sense
- Users can correct mistakes immediately
- Tool use and exploration are features, not bugs

### Type 2: Background Automation (No Human Oversight)
- Examples: Customer service bots, data processing, workflow automation
- Every LLM call is a risk
- Errors compound silently
- Determinism is crucial

### The Difference in Practice

```python
# Type 1: AI Assistant (Multiple LLM calls OK)
def ai_assistant_approach(user_query):
    # Let the LLM explore and use multiple tools
    response = llm.chat(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_query}],
        tools=[search_tool, calculator_tool, database_tool, email_tool]
    )
    return response  # User can correct if wrong

# Type 2: Background Automation (Minimize LLM calls)
def automation_approach(ticket_data):
    # Deterministic routing first
    if ticket_data.type == "refund":
        return handle_refund_deterministically(ticket_data)
    
    # Only use LLM when absolutely necessary
    if requires_reasoning(ticket_data):
        context = prepare_specific_context(ticket_data)
        response = llm.chat(
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": context}],
            # No tools! Direct response only
        )
        return validate_and_process(response)
    
    return standard_response(ticket_data)
```

Most of you aren't building the next ChatGPT. You're building backend automations. So let's focus on that.

## Building Block #1: The Intelligence Layer 🧠

This is the only actual AI component. Everything else is just software engineering.

### 1_intelligence.py - The Simplest LLM Call

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

def get_llm_response(prompt):
    """The atomic unit of AI: send prompt, get response"""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Example usage
result = get_llm_response("Explain quantum computing in one sentence")
print(result)
```

That's it. No frameworks. No abstractions. Just an API call.

**Key insight**: The hard part isn't making the call—it's everything around it.

## Building Block #2: Memory (State Management) 💾

LLMs are goldfish. They remember nothing. You have to manually maintain conversation state.

### 2_memory.py - Maintaining Conversation History

```python
def chat_with_memory(conversation_history, new_message):
    """Maintain conversation state across interactions"""
    
    # Add new message to history
    conversation_history.append({"role": "user", "content": new_message})
    
    # Send entire history to LLM
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=conversation_history
    )
    
    # Add response to history
    assistant_message = response.choices[0].message
    conversation_history.append({
        "role": "assistant", 
        "content": assistant_message.content
    })
    
    return assistant_message.content, conversation_history

# Example: Maintaining context
history = []
response1, history = chat_with_memory(history, "My name is Dave")
response2, history = chat_with_memory(history, "What's my name?")
# Response2: "Your name is Dave"
```

<Callout type="info">
**Pro tip**: In production, store conversation history in a database, not memory. Add user IDs, timestamps, and token counts for proper management.
</Callout>

## Building Block #3: Tools (External Integration) 🔧

Sometimes your LLM needs to actually DO things, not just talk. That's where tools come in.

### 3_tools.py - Function Calling Pattern

```python
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Simulated weather API call"""
    # In reality, this would call a weather API
    return f"Weather in {location}: 72°F, sunny"

# Define tool schema for LLM
tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current weather for a location",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "City name"
                }
            },
            "required": ["location"]
        }
    }
}]

def chat_with_tools(prompt):
    # First LLM call - decides if tool is needed
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        tools=tools,
        tool_choice="auto"
    )
    
    message = response.choices[0].message
    
    # Check if LLM wants to use a tool
    if message.tool_calls:
        tool_call = message.tool_calls[0]
        
        # Execute the actual function
        if tool_call.function.name == "get_weather":
            args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
            result = get_weather(args["location"])
            
            # Second LLM call - format result for user
            final_response = client.chat.completions.create(
                model="gpt-4o-mini",
                messages=[
                    {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
                    message,
                    {
                        "role": "tool",
                        "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
                        "content": result
                    }
                ]
            )
            
            return final_response.choices[0].message.content
    
    return message.content
```

**Critical insight**: Tools require multiple LLM calls. Use sparingly in production.

## Building Block #4: Validation (Structured Output) ✅

The secret to reliable AI systems? Force LLMs to return structured data you can validate.

### 4_validation.py - Structured Output with Pydantic

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Literal

class TaskExtraction(BaseModel):
    task: str
    priority: Literal["high", "medium", "low"]
    due_date: str | None
    
def extract_task_info(user_input: str) -> TaskExtraction:
    """Force LLM to return structured, validated data"""
    
    response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system", 
                "content": "Extract task information from user input"
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": user_input}
        ],
        response_format=TaskExtraction
    )
    
    # This is now a validated Pydantic object!
    return response.choices[0].message.parsed

# Example usage
user_input = "I need to finish the report by Friday, it's high priority"
task_info = extract_task_info(user_input)

print(f"Task: {task_info.task}")
print(f"Priority: {task_info.priority}")
print(f"Due: {task_info.due_date}")

# Now you can use this data programmatically
if task_info.priority == "high":
    send_urgent_notification(task_info)
```

<Callout type="success">
**Game changer**: Structured output turns unreliable text generation into reliable data extraction. This is how you build systems you can trust.
</Callout>

## Building Block #5: Control Flow (Deterministic Routing) 🚦

Here's where Dave's approach gets brilliant. Instead of letting LLMs make every decision, use them for classification, then handle routing with good old if/else statements.

### 5_control.py - Smart Routing Pattern

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Literal

class IntentClassification(BaseModel):
    intent: Literal["question", "request", "complaint"]
    confidence: float
    reasoning: str

def classify_intent(user_message: str) -> IntentClassification:
    """Use LLM to classify, not execute"""
    response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "Classify the user's intent. Provide reasoning."
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
        ],
        response_format=IntentClassification
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.parsed

def handle_user_input(message: str):
    """Deterministic routing based on LLM classification"""
    
    # One LLM call for classification
    intent = classify_intent(message)
    
    # Log for debugging (this is gold!)
    print(f"Intent: {intent.intent}")
    print(f"Reasoning: {intent.reasoning}")
    print(f"Confidence: {intent.confidence}")
    
    # Deterministic routing - no more LLM calls!
    if intent.intent == "question":
        return handle_question(message)
    elif intent.intent == "request":
        return handle_request(message)
    elif intent.intent == "complaint":
        return handle_complaint(message, intent.confidence)

def handle_complaint(message: str, confidence: float):
    if confidence > 0.8:
        # Route to senior support
        return escalate_to_human(message)
    else:
        # Get more information
        return "I understand you have a concern. Could you provide more details?"
```

**Why this beats tool calling**:
1. Full visibility into decision-making
2. Easy to debug (you see the reasoning!)
3. Deterministic execution paths
4. One LLM call instead of multiple

## Building Block #6: Recovery (Error Handling) 🛡️

Production reality: Everything fails. APIs go down. LLMs return nonsense. Rate limits hit. Plan for it.

### 6_recovery.py - Production-Grade Error Handling

```python
import time
from typing import Optional
import logging

class LLMError(Exception):
    pass

def reliable_llm_call(
    prompt: str, 
    max_retries: int = 3,
    backoff_factor: float = 2.0
) -> Optional[str]:
    """Production-ready LLM call with retry logic"""
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = client.chat.completions.create(
                model="gpt-4o-mini",
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
                timeout=30  # Always set timeouts!
            )
            
            result = response.choices[0].message.content
            
            # Validate response isn't empty or error-like
            if not result or "error" in result.lower():
                raise LLMError("Invalid response from LLM")
                
            return result
            
        except Exception as e:
            logging.warning(f"LLM call failed (attempt {attempt + 1}): {e}")
            
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                # Exponential backoff
                sleep_time = backoff_factor ** attempt
                time.sleep(sleep_time)
            else:
                # Final attempt failed
                logging.error(f"LLM call failed after {max_retries} attempts")
                return None
    
    return None

def safe_process_ticket(ticket):
    """Example of graceful degradation"""
    
    # Try intelligent processing
    ai_response = reliable_llm_call(f"Process this ticket: {ticket}")
    
    if ai_response:
        return ai_response
    else:
        # Fallback to rule-based processing
        logging.info("Falling back to rule-based processing")
        
        if "refund" in ticket.lower():
            return "I've forwarded your refund request to our finance team."
        elif "technical" in ticket.lower():
            return "I've created a support ticket for our technical team."
        else:
            return "Thank you for contacting us. A human agent will respond within 24 hours."
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Production tip**: Always have a fallback. It's better to give a generic response than to crash.
</Callout>

## Building Block #7: Feedback (Human in the Loop) 👥

For critical operations, add approval checkpoints. Not everything should be fully autonomous.

### 7_feedback.py - Human Approval Pattern

```python
from enum import Enum
from datetime import datetime

class ApprovalStatus(Enum):
    PENDING = "pending"
    APPROVED = "approved"
    REJECTED = "rejected"

class ApprovalRequest:
    def __init__(self, content: str, context: dict):
        self.id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.content = content
        self.context = context
        self.status = ApprovalStatus.PENDING
        self.created_at = datetime.now()
        self.reviewed_at = None
        self.reviewer = None
        
def generate_with_approval(prompt: str, requires_approval: bool = True):
    """Generate content with optional human approval"""
    
    # Generate initial content
    content = get_llm_response(prompt)
    
    if not requires_approval:
        return content
        
    # Create approval request
    approval_req = ApprovalRequest(
        content=content,
        context={"prompt": prompt, "model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
    )
    
    # In production, this would:
    # 1. Store in database
    # 2. Send notification (Slack, email, etc.)
    # 3. Wait for webhook response
    
    # Simulated approval flow
    print(f"\n🔔 APPROVAL REQUIRED")
    print(f"Generated content: {content[:100]}...")
    print(f"Approve? (yes/no): ", end="")
    
    user_input = input().strip().lower()
    
    if user_input == "yes":
        approval_req.status = ApprovalStatus.APPROVED
        approval_req.reviewed_at = datetime.now()
        
        # Log approval for audit trail
        log_approval(approval_req)
        
        return content
    else:
        approval_req.status = ApprovalStatus.REJECTED
        approval_req.reviewed_at = datetime.now()
        
        # Could regenerate or return fallback
        return None

# Example: High-stakes email generation
def send_customer_email(customer_id: str, issue: str):
    prompt = f"Write apology email for customer {customer_id} about {issue}"
    
    email_content = generate_with_approval(
        prompt=prompt,
        requires_approval=True  # Always approve customer communications
    )
    
    if email_content:
        send_email(customer_id, email_content)
    else:
        log_failed_generation(customer_id, issue)
```

## Putting It All Together: The Production Pattern 🏗️

Here's how these building blocks combine into a production-ready system:

### Complete Workflow Example

```python
class ReliableAIAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = {}  # Building Block 2
        self.error_count = 0  # Building Block 6
        
    def process_request(self, user_id: str, message: str):
        """Complete production workflow using all building blocks"""
        
        try:
            # Building Block 2: Retrieve memory
            conversation = self.memory.get(user_id, [])
            
            # Building Block 5: Classify intent first
            intent = self.classify_with_validation(message)
            
            # Building Block 5: Deterministic routing
            if intent.intent == "sensitive_request":
                # Building Block 7: Human approval for sensitive ops
                return self.handle_with_approval(message, intent)
                
            elif intent.confidence < 0.7:
                # Low confidence - gather more info
                return "I'm not quite sure I understand. Could you rephrase?"
                
            else:
                # Building Block 1: Use LLM only when needed
                response = self.generate_response(message, conversation)
                
                # Building Block 2: Update memory
                conversation.append({"role": "user", "content": message})
                conversation.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
                self.memory[user_id] = conversation[-10:]  # Keep last 10
                
                return response
                
        except Exception as e:
            # Building Block 6: Recovery
            self.error_count += 1
            
            if self.error_count > 5:
                # Circuit breaker pattern
                return "System is experiencing issues. Please try again later."
                
            # Fallback response
            return self.get_fallback_response(message)
    
    def classify_with_validation(self, message: str):
        """Building Block 4: Structured output with validation"""
        for attempt in range(3):
            try:
                classification = classify_intent(message)
                
                # Validate the response
                if classification.confidence < 0.3:
                    raise ValueError("Confidence too low")
                    
                return classification
                
            except Exception as e:
                if attempt == 2:
                    # Return safe default
                    return IntentClassification(
                        intent="unknown",
                        confidence=0.0,
                        reasoning="Classification failed"
                    )
                continue
```

## The Shocking Truth About Production AI 🤯

After building 20+ production systems, here's what Dave discovered:

<Callout type="info">
**The 90/10 Rule**: 90% of your "AI" system should be deterministic code. Only 10% should involve LLM calls.

Most successful AI applications are just regular software with strategic LLM calls placed exactly where they add value.
</Callout>

## Your 7-Day Implementation Plan 📅

### Day 1-2: Foundation
- Set up direct API access (no frameworks)
- Implement basic error handling
- Create structured output schemas for your use case

### Day 3-4: Control Flow
- Map out your deterministic decision tree
- Identify where you REALLY need LLM reasoning
- Build classification-based routing

### Day 5-6: Production Hardening
- Add retry logic and fallbacks
- Implement conversation memory
- Set up monitoring and logging

### Day 7: Human in the Loop
- Identify high-risk operations
- Add approval checkpoints
- Create audit trails

## The Framework-Free Future 🚀

Here's the controversial take that changes everything: **You don't need AI frameworks**. You need software engineering.

The seven building blocks are:
1. **Intelligence**: Direct LLM API calls
2. **Memory**: State management
3. **Tools**: External integrations (use sparingly)
4. **Validation**: Structured output with schemas
5. **Control**: Deterministic routing
6. **Recovery**: Error handling and fallbacks
7. **Feedback**: Human approval for critical ops

That's it. No LangChain. No complex abstractions. Just clean, maintainable code that you understand completely.

<Callout type="success">
**The Payoff**: Teams using this approach report:
- 80% fewer production incidents
- 10x faster debugging
- 90% reduction in LLM costs
- Actually sleeping at night
</Callout>
