Welcome back, engineers. Imagine starting your day: you open up the terminal, fire up Claude Code, then kick off a single prompt `/cook` that does the work it used to take you hours in minutes.

You're able to accomplish this with Claude Code sub-agents. You've created workflows of specialized agents that do one thing and do it extraordinarily well.

But here's where it gets wild: **My agents are building my agents**.

Code is a commodity. Your fine-tuned prompts can be valuable. And now your Claude Code sub-agents can yield extreme value for your engineering if you know how to avoid the big two mistakes engineers are making with sub-agents.

## Understanding Sub-Agent Architecture 🏗️

First things first: sub-agents don't work like you think they work. Let me explain.

<CodeExample
  title="The Flow of Claude Code Agents"
  language="text"
  code={`┌─────────┐      ┌───────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│   YOU   │ ───► │ PRIMARY AGENT │ ───► │  SUB-AGENT   │
│         │      │               │      │              │
│         │ ◄─── │               │ ◄─── │              │
└─────────┘      └───────────────┘      └──────────────┘
                         │                      │
                         │      ┌──────────────┐│
                         └────► │  SUB-AGENT   ││
                                │              ││
                                └──────────────┘│
                                 └──────────────┘

Key insight: Sub-agents respond to your PRIMARY agent, not to you!`}
/>

This flow is absolutely critical. You prompt your primary agent, and then your primary agent prompts individual sub-agents based on your original prompt. Your sub-agents respond not to you—they respond to your primary agent.

<Callout type="warning">
**Big Mistake #1**: Many engineers miss this fact, and it changes the way you write your sub-agent prompts. What you're writing is the **system prompt** of your sub-agent, not the user prompt.
</Callout>

## The Anatomy of a Sub-Agent 🔬

Let's break down exactly what Claude Code sub-agents look like:

<CodeExample
  title="Sub-Agent Configuration Structure"
  language="yaml"
  code={`# agents/hello-world.yaml
name: hello-world
description: |
  If they say "hi claude" or "hi CC" or "hi claude code", use this agent.
  This agent provides a friendly greeting with current tech news.
tools:
  - bash
  - read_file
color: yellow

# The actual prompt (system prompt for the sub-agent)
prompt: |
  ## Purpose
  You are a friendly greeting agent that responds with warmth and current tech insights.
  
  ## Instructions
  1. Greet the user warmly
  2. Share one interesting tech fact or news
  3. Ask how you can help
  
  ## Report Format
  IMPORTANT: Respond to the primary agent with:
  "Please tell the user: [your message here]"
  
  Remember: You're communicating with Claude (primary agent), not the user directly.`}
/>

### Critical Understanding

The prompt you write here is the **system prompt** of your sub-agent. This is not what triggers the agent—it's what defines its behavior. Your primary agent will prompt this sub-agent based on the description field.

<CodeExample
  title="Sub-Agent Invocation Example"
  language="bash"
  code={`# In your terminal
$ claude
> Hi CC!

# What happens internally:
1. Primary agent reads your input
2. Checks all agent descriptions
3. Finds match: "If they say 'hi CC'..."
4. Invokes hello-world agent
5. Sub-agent executes and reports back
6. Primary agent relays the response to you`}
/>

## Avoiding the Two Big Mistakes 🚨

### Mistake #1: Misunderstanding Communication Flow

<CodeExample
  title="Wrong vs Right Sub-Agent Communication"
  language="yaml"
  code={`# ❌ WRONG - Direct user communication
prompt: |
  Hi! I'm your friendly assistant.
  How can I help you today?

# ✅ RIGHT - Primary agent communication
prompt: |
  ## Report to Primary Agent
  When invoked, analyze the request and respond with:
  "Please tell the user: [structured response]"
  
  Never assume direct user communication.`}
/>

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Context Limitations

Sub-agents start fresh—they have NO context of your conversation history. This is both a feature and a limitation.

<CodeExample
  title="Context-Aware Sub-Agent Design"
  language="yaml"
  code={`# In your sub-agent prompt:
prompt: |
  ## Context Handling
  You have NO prior conversation context.
  The primary agent will provide all necessary information.
  
  ## Expected Input Format
  The primary agent should provide:
  - Current task description
  - Relevant file paths
  - Any necessary context
  
  ## Response Protocol
  Always acknowledge what context you received and what you're doing with it.`}
/>

## Building a Meta-Agent 🤖

Now for the exciting part—agents that build agents:

<CodeExample
  title="Meta-Agent for Creating Sub-Agents"
  language="yaml"
  code={`# agents/meta-agent.yaml
name: meta-agent
description: |
  PROACTIVELY use this when user asks to "create a new sub-agent" or 
  "build an agent" or mentions needing automation for specific tasks.
tools:
  - write_file
  - read_file
  - web_fetch
color: purple

prompt: |
  ## Purpose
  Generate complete Claude Code sub-agent configurations from user descriptions.
  
  ## Process
  1. Fetch latest Claude Code documentation on agents
  2. Analyze the user's requirements
  3. Design appropriate agent configuration
  4. Generate the complete YAML file
  
  ## Agent Creation Guidelines
  
  ### Name
  - Use kebab-case
  - Be descriptive but concise
  - Example: "code-reviewer", "test-generator"
  
  ### Description
  - Include CLEAR trigger conditions
  - Use phrases like "If they say X" or "When user requests Y"
  - Add instructions for the primary agent on how to prompt this agent
  
  ### Tools
  - Only include necessary tools
  - Consider security implications
  - Common: bash, read_file, write_file, edit_file
  
  ### Prompt Structure
  Always include:
  1. ## Purpose - What this agent does
  2. ## Process - Step-by-step workflow
  3. ## Best Practices - Important constraints
  4. ## Report Format - How to communicate back
  
  ### Important Reminders
  - Every word must add value
  - No pleasantries
  - Focus on efficiency
  - Include "IMPORTANT: This agent has no conversation context"`}
/>

## Real-World Example: Text-to-Speech Agent 🔊

Let's walk through creating a practical agent using our meta-agent:

<CodeExample
  title="Creating a TTS Summary Agent"
  language="bash"
  code={`# Step 1: Identify the problem
Problem: "When doing agentic coding at scale, I lose track of what agents have done"
Solution: "Add text-to-speech to agents so they notify me when done"

# Step 2: Use meta-agent to build solution
$ claude
> Build a new sub-agent that:
> - Summarizes completed work in one sentence
> - Uses 11Labs text-to-speech to speak the summary
> - Triggers when I say "tts summary" or after major tasks`}
/>

The meta-agent creates:

<CodeExample
  title="Generated TTS Summary Agent"
  language="yaml"
  code={`# agents/work-completion-summary.yaml
name: work-completion-summary
description: |
  If they say "tts", "tts summary", use this agent.
  When you prompt this agent, describe exactly what work was completed.
  IMPORTANT: This agent has no context of conversations between you and user.
tools:
  - bash
  - eleven_labs_tts
  - play_audio
color: green

prompt: |
  ## Purpose
  Provide concise audio summaries of completed work using text-to-speech.
  
  ## Process
  1. Extract key accomplishment from input
  2. Create one-sentence summary (max 15 words)
  3. Generate speech using 11Labs
  4. Play audio notification
  
  ## Best Practices
  - IMPORTANT: Run only bash, pwd, and 11Labs MCP tools
  - Keep summaries under 15 words
  - Focus on WHAT was done, not how
  - Use active voice
  
  ## Report Format
  Respond with: "Audio summary delivered: [summary text]"`}
/>

## Advanced Patterns 🚀

### Pattern 1: Chained Sub-Agents

<CodeExample
  title="Multi-Stage Agent Workflow"
  language="typescript"
  code={`// In your custom command
const workflow = {
  stage1: "analyze-codebase",    // First sub-agent
  stage2: "generate-tests",       // Second sub-agent  
  stage3: "run-validation",       // Third sub-agent
  stage4: "create-pr"            // Final sub-agent
};

// Primary agent orchestrates the chain
// Each agent's output feeds into the next`}
/>

### Pattern 2: Specialized Codebase Agents

<CodeExample
  title="Domain-Specific Agent"
  language="yaml"
  code={`name: auth-system-expert
description: |
  Use for ANY questions or changes related to authentication,
  login, JWT tokens, or user sessions.
  This agent has deep knowledge of our auth patterns.
  
prompt: |
  ## Specialized Knowledge
  You are an expert in this codebase's authentication system:
  - JWT implementation in src/auth/jwt.ts
  - Session management in src/auth/sessions.ts
  - OAuth providers in src/auth/providers/
  
  ## Always Check
  1. Current auth flow before changes
  2. Security implications
  3. Existing test coverage`}
/>

### Pattern 3: Context Injection

<CodeExample
  title="Rich Context Sub-Agent"
  language="yaml"
  code={`# In primary agent's description field
description: |
  When prompting this agent, always provide:
  1. Current file path
  2. Recent changes made
  3. Overall goal
  4. Any errors encountered
  
  Format as JSON:
  {
    "context": {
      "currentFile": "path/to/file",
      "recentChanges": ["change1", "change2"],
      "goal": "refactor authentication",
      "errors": []
    },
    "request": "specific task"
  }`}
/>

## Benefits and Trade-offs ⚖️

### Benefits ✅

1. **Context Preservation**: Each sub-agent operates in its own clean context
2. **Specialized Expertise**: Fine-tune instructions and tools per agent
3. **Reusability**: Store agents in your repo for team use
4. **Flexible Permissions**: Lock down tools per agent
5. **Focused Performance**: Single-purpose agents make fewer mistakes
6. **Simple Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Build complex workflows easily

### Trade-offs ❌

1. **No Context History**: Sub-agents start fresh every time
2. **Hard to Debug**: Limited visibility into sub-agent operations
3. **Decision Overload**: Too many agents confuse the primary agent
4. **Dependency Coupling**: Changes to one agent can break workflows
5. **No Nested Sub-Agents**: Can't call sub-agents from sub-agents

<Callout type="info">
**Pro Tip**: Start with 3-5 highly focused agents. Add more only when you have clear, distinct use cases. Quality over quantity.
</Callout>

## Best Practices 🎯

### 1. Clear Trigger Conditions
```yaml
# ✅ Good
description: |
  If they mention "deploy", "deployment", or "ship to production"
  
# ❌ Bad  
description: |
  For deployment-related tasks
```

### 2. Explicit Communication Protocols
```yaml
prompt: |
  ## Response Format
  - For success: "Completed: [what you did]"
  - For errors: "Failed: [reason] - Need: [what would help]"
  - For questions: "Clarify: [specific question]"
```

### 3. Tool Minimization
```yaml
# Only what's needed
tools:
  - read_file    # For analysis
  - web_search   # For research
# Not the kitchen sink
```

### 4. Description as Documentation
```yaml
description: |
  Code review agent for TypeScript/React projects.
  Triggers: "review", "check code", "code review"
  
  When prompting, provide:
  - File paths to review
  - Type of review (security/performance/style)
  - Specific concerns if any
  
  This agent will check for common issues and suggest improvements.
```

## Scaling Your Sub-Agent System 📈

As you build more agents:

1. **Organize by Domain**
   ```
   agents/
   ├── auth/
   ├── testing/
   ├── deployment/
   └── utilities/
   ```

2. **Version Control**
   - Track agent changes in git
   - Document why agents were created
   - Review agent performance regularly

3. **Monitor Usage**
   - Which agents get called most?
   - Which ones fail often?
   - Where are the gaps?

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Update descriptions based on misfires
   - Refine prompts based on outputs
   - Consolidate similar agents

<Callout type="success">
**The Meta-Agent Advantage**: Once you have a meta-agent, creating new specialized agents takes minutes, not hours. You're not just automating tasks—you're automating automation itself.
</Callout>

## The Future is Multi-Agent 🌟

We're moving from:
- **Single agent** → **Multiple specialized agents**
- **Manual coordination** → **Automated orchestration**  
- **Static tools** → **Self-improving systems**

Sub-agents are your building blocks. Meta-agents are your architects. Together, they create systems that evolve with your needs.

Start simple: Create one sub-agent for a repetitive task. Then create a meta-agent. Then watch as your AI agents start building themselves.

The future isn't just about AI doing work—it's about AI systems that improve themselves. And with Claude Code sub-agents, that future is here.

Welcome to the age of self-building AI.
