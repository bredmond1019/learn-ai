"Generative AI is not the magical pill that solves everything that a lot of people seem to think it is."

Randall Hunt doesn't mince words. After building 200+ enterprise GenAI deployments at Caylent‚Äîfrom Fortune 500 giants to scrappy startups‚Äîhe's seen every way these projects can fail. And succeed.

The former SpaceX CI/CD lead (fun fact: no rockets exploded on his watch) and MongoDB engineer turned AWS partner has a message for every team rushing to production with their ChatGPT wrapper: You're probably doing it wrong.

But he's also here to show you how to do it right.

## The Reality Check: What Actually Gets Built üèóÔ∏è

Let's start with what Caylent actually ships to production:

- **BrainBox AI**: Building operating system managing 10,000+ buildings, reducing greenhouse emissions (Time's 100 Best Inventions)
- **Nature Footage**: Multimodal video search across thousands of hours of wildlife footage
- **Sports Analytics**: Real-time highlight detection processing millions of frames
- **Hospital Systems**: Clinical documentation tools (spoiler: nurses hate voice bots)

Notice what's missing? Basic chatbots. Todo list apps. Simple RAG demos.

<Callout type="warning">
**The Wall Street Journal Problem**: What your CTO read in the WSJ about AI is not necessarily the latest and greatest thing. In fact, it's probably already outdated by the time it's printed.
</Callout>

## The Architectural Truth Bomb üí£

After 200+ deployments, here's the architecture that actually works:

<CodeExample
  title="The Production-Ready Stack"
  language="text"
  code={`1. Foundation Layer
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AWS Bedrock / SageMaker
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Custom Silicon (Trainium/Inferentia - 60% cost savings)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Now 40% cheaper GPU instances (just announced!)

2. Model Layer
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Claude, Nova, Llama, DeepSeek
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Embeddings: Titan V2 Multimodal
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Open source when it makes sense

3. Storage Layer
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PostgreSQL + pgvector (Randall's favorite)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OpenSearch for faceted search
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Redis for speed (but $$$)

4. The Secret Sauce
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Context Management (THIS is your moat)`}
/>

But here's the kicker: All of this is incidental. What matters is your inputs and outputs.

## Lesson #1: Eval, Eval, Eval, Eval üìä

Channel your inner Steve Ballmer, but instead of screaming "Developers!", scream "EVAL!"

<CodeExample
  title="The Eval Evolution"
  language="python"
  code={`# Day 1: The Vibe Check
response = llm.complete("Summarize this document")
print("Looks good to me! üëç")

# Day 2: Your First Real Eval
def evaluate_summary(original, summary):
    return "important_keyword" in summary  # Boolean is fine!

# Day 30: Production Eval Suite
class SummaryEval:
    def __init__(self):
        self.test_cases = load_production_samples()
        self.metrics = ["accuracy", "completeness", "hallucination_rate"]
    
    def run(self, model_version):
        # Test on REAL production data
        # Not synthetic benchmarks
        return self.evaluate_all_cases()`}
/>

**The Brutal Truth**: Metrics don't have to be complex. A simple boolean "did this work?" is often better than a complex BERT score.

## Lesson #2: Embeddings Alone Will Betray You üó°Ô∏è

"Embeddings alone do not a great query system make."

Real conversation from a client meeting:
- Client: "We need semantic search!"
- Randall: "Great! How will users filter by date?"
- Client: "..."
- Randall: "By category?"
- Client: "..."
- Randall: "This is why you need PostgreSQL."

<Callout type="insight">
**The Hybrid Approach**: 
- Embeddings for semantic similarity
- Traditional indexes for filters
- Faceted search for user experience
- All in one database (PostgreSQL with pgvector FTW)
</Callout>

## Lesson #3: Speed Kills (Your User Adoption) ‚ö°

The speed hierarchy of what actually works:

1. **Fast + Cheap**: Winner
2. **Slow + Cheap + Good UX**: Acceptable (spinners help!)
3. **Slow + Expensive**: Dead on arrival
4. **Fast + Expensive**: Only for critical use cases

<CodeExample
  title="The Multimodal Speed Hack"
  language="python"
  code={`# Naive approach: Process entire video
def analyze_sports_video_slow(video_path):
    frames = extract_all_frames(video_path)  # 30fps * 3 hours = death
    return process_frames(frames)

# Production approach: Audio amplitude FTW
def find_highlights_fast(video_path):
    # Extract audio track
    audio = ffmpeg.extract_audio(video_path)
    
    # Get amplitude spectrograph
    amplitude = get_amplitude_graph(audio)
    
    # Find peaks (crowd cheering = highlights!)
    highlights = find_peaks(amplitude, threshold=0.8)
    
    # Only process these specific moments
    return process_specific_frames(video_path, highlights)`}
/>

One client reduced processing time from 6 hours to 3 minutes with this one trick. Sports broadcasters hate him!

## Lesson #4: Know Your Users (They're Not Who You Think) üë•

The **Voice Bot Disaster** story:

1. Built sophisticated voice interface for hospital nurses
2. State-of-the-art transcription
3. Natural conversation flow
4. Nurses **hated** it

Why? Hospitals are LOUD. Voice transcription picked up:
- Other conversations
- Medical equipment beeping  
- Overhead announcements
- General chaos

Solution? A boring text interface. Adoption went from 5% to 85%.

<Callout type="warning">
**The Remote User Problem**: 
- Built beautiful PDF summaries
- Attached 200MB PDFs
- Users in remote areas with slow internet couldn't download
- Solution: Screenshot just the relevant page + text summary
</Callout>

## Lesson #5: Stop Building Stupid Tools üõ†Ô∏è

The number of times Randall sees this makes him want to scream:

<CodeExample
  title="The Tool Antipattern"
  language="python"
  code={`# ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è STOP DOING THIS
tools = [{
    "name": "get_current_date",
    "description": "Gets the current date",
    "function": lambda: datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
}]

# ‚úÖ DO THIS INSTEAD
prompt = f"""
Current date: {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}
User query: {user_input}
"""

# You control the prompt! Just put the data there!`}
/>

Other unnecessary tools Randall has seen:
- Basic math operations
- String formatting
- Simple lookups
- Anything that takes < 1ms to compute

## Lesson #6: Prompt Engineering > Fine-Tuning üéØ

"I used to say we should fine-tune. It turns out I was wrong."

The progression of model improvements:
- Claude 3.5 ‚Üí 3.7: Some regressions
- Claude 3.7 ‚Üí 4.0: **Zero regressions**, faster, cheaper, better

<Callout type="success">
**The New Reality**: Prompt engineering has proven unreasonably effective. More effective than Randall would have predicted. Save fine-tuning for when you really need it (you probably don't).
</Callout>

## Lesson #7: The Economics Will Eat You Alive üí∏

Real production costs from Caylent's clients:

<CodeExample
  title="The Cost Reality"
  language="text"
  code={`Video Processing Platform:
- Infrastructure: $4,000/month
- LLM API calls: $5,000/month
- Human time saved: $50,000/month
- ROI: Clear win ‚úÖ

Failed Chatbot:
- Infrastructure: $500/month
- LLM API calls: $8,000/month (Opus models)
- Value generated: "It's nice I guess?"
- ROI: Terminated after 2 months ‚ùå`}
/>

Cost optimization strategies that work:
1. **Batch processing**: 50% off on Bedrock
2. **Prompt caching**: Reuse system prompts
3. **Context optimization**: Minimum viable context
4. **Model selection**: Haiku for classification, Sonnet for reasoning

## The Context Management Revolution üéØ

This is your actual moat. Not your model. Not your framework. Your context.

<CodeExample
  title="Context Is Everything"
  language="python"
  code={`# Basic context (everyone has this)
context = {
    "user_query": "Show me sales data",
    "user_id": "12345"
}

# Winning context (your moat)
context = {
    "user_query": "Show me sales data",
    "user_id": "12345",
    "current_page": "/dashboard/northeast",
    "previous_queries": ["filter by Q4", "compare to last year"],
    "user_role": "Regional Manager",
    "time_of_day": "end of quarter",
    "device_type": "mobile",
    "connection_speed": "slow",
    "preferred_viz_type": "charts_not_tables"
}

# Result: Completely different (and better) experience`}
/>

## The Generative UI Revolution üé®

One of Caylent's customers, CloudZero, originally wanted a chatbot for AWS cost optimization. What they built instead will blow your mind:

<CodeExample
  title="Just-In-Time UI Generation"
  language="typescript"
  code={`// Traditional approach
if (query.includes("costs")) {
    return <CostChart data={data} />;
}

// Generative UI approach
const GenerativeResponse = async ({ query, context }) => {
    // LLM generates React component on the fly
    const componentCode = await llm.generateUI({
        query,
        context,
        previousComponents: cache.getRelevant(query),
        style: userPreferences
    });
    
    // Compile and render
    const Component = compileComponent(componentCode);
    
    // Cache for future similar queries
    cache.store(query, Component);
    
    return <Component data={data} />;
};`}
/>

Result: Personalized visualizations that evolve with user needs. No more static dashboards.

## The Production Playbook üìö

After 200+ deployments, here's the playbook that works:

### 1. Start with the "Why"
- What's the ROI?
- What specific metric improves?
- Who loses their job if this fails? (harsh but important)

### 2. Define Your True Moat
It's not the LLM. It's probably:
- Your data
- Your context
- Your domain expertise
- Your integration points

### 3. Build Your Eval Suite First
- Start with vibe checks
- Convert to boolean tests
- Use production data
- Measure what matters to the business

### 4. Optimize for Reality
- Users have slow internet
- Hospitals are noisy
- People are impatient
- Inference costs compound

### 5. Architecture for Change
```
Your System = Inputs/Outputs (stable)
            + Evals (critical)
            + Everything else (will change)
```

## The Brutal Truths Nobody Tells You üé≠

1. **Your POC performance is a lie**: Production data is messier, users are less forgiving, edge cases are weirder

2. **Fancy frameworks are a crutch**: The teams shipping to production are using boring tools well

3. **Context beats intelligence**: A dumber model with better context outperforms a smarter model flying blind

4. **Users don't care about your tech**: They care if it works, if it's fast, and if it saves them time

5. **The best AI UX might not include AI**: Sometimes a good search box beats a chatbot

## Your 30-Day Production Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

**Week 1: Reality Check**
- Define ONE metric that matters
- Talk to 10 actual users
- Build 20 test cases from real data

**Week 2: Minimum Viable Context**
- What context do you already have?
- What's the least you need for good results?
- How fast can you retrieve it?

**Week 3: Speed Run**
- Measure baseline performance
- Find the bottlenecks (hint: it's not the LLM)
- Implement caching and batching

**Week 4: Production Hardening**
- Add fallbacks for every external call
- Implement cost monitoring
- Build escape hatches for when AI fails

<Callout type="action">
**The Bottom Line**: Stop reading about AI in the Wall Street Journal. Stop chasing the latest framework. Start building boring solutions to real problems. That's where the money is.

Want to build something real? Focus on:
1. Eval (scream it!)
2. Context (hoard it!)
3. Speed (optimize it!)
4. Economics (watch it!)

Everything else is just expensive noise.
</Callout>

Welcome to production. It's messier than your POC, harder than your demo, and more rewarding than you imagined.

Now go build something that actually works.
