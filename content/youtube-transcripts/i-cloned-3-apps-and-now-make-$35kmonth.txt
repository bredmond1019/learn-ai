[00:00]  [00:00] My name is Samuel and I run three apps [00:02] making $35,000 a month. [00:04] You might think you need to come up with [00:06] a completely new idea. But I just met a [00:09] guy who does the exact opposite. His [00:12] strategy is simple. One, find an app [00:14] that's working. And two, make it 1% [00:17] better. [00:18] If it's already successful, I know it's [00:20] validating. [00:21] But don't be fooled. He's not just [00:23] copying and pasting. And in this [00:25] episode, he breaks down his meticulous [00:27] method for finding winning ideas and [00:29] turning them into successful apps. We'll [00:32] get into where the best ideas are hiding [00:34] in plain sight, how to validate fast so [00:36] you don't waste months working on a [00:38] failed project, and the playbook for [00:40] researching and replicating successful [00:42] apps that you can put into practice [00:44] today. All right, let's dive in. I'm Pat [00:47] Walls, and this is Starter Story. [00:52] [Music] [00:53]  [00:53] All right, welcome Samuel to the [00:55] channel. Thanks for coming on. Tell me [00:57] about who you are and what's your story. [00:58] So, my name is Samuel Rondo. I used to [01:01] have a full-time job, but I quit a few [01:03] years ago and I taught myself to code on [01:05] YouTube and now I run three SAS apps [01:07] that are making $35,000 per month. [01:10] Okay, cool. So, before we get into all [01:11]  [01:12] your apps and how they grew, you said [01:14] that you actually taught yourself how to [01:16] code. How did you do that? And could you [01:18] break that down for us? So yeah, [01:19] actually I used to be an optician and I [01:21] had the zero coding experience. At the [01:23] time I wanted to rebuild a tool I was [01:25] using for Instagram, but this time I [01:27] wanted to build it myself using code. I [01:29] ended up following a 15-hour course on [01:32] YouTube. And every time I learn [01:33] something new in the course, I [01:35] immediately try to apply it to that tool [01:37] I was building. So if you just watch a [01:39] course, most of the time it's not enough [01:41] because you end up losing yourself in [01:44] the languages that you will probably [01:46] never use and you don't really see why [01:48] you are learning what you are learning. [01:50] But yeah, it all starting like this [01:52] following a YouTube course and it [01:54] quickly became a passion for me. [01:56] Cool. All right. Well, for anyone [01:57] watching this today who wants to learn [01:58]  [01:58] how to code, how to build apps, what [02:00] would be your advice? What would be your [02:02] framework or playbook or how you'd get [02:03] started? If I were 18 years old now, I [02:06] don't think I would learn to code the [02:08] traditional way. I would probably just [02:10] use AI coding tools. And with AI today, [02:12] you can literally build like 90% of most [02:15] apps. So my framework today would be [02:18] one, pick a real project. Two, ask JPT [02:21] what you need to learn to build it. So [02:23] for example, you go on Google or on [02:24] Twitter and you find a product you like [02:26] and you take a screenshot of that page [02:28] and you ask JPT, how can I build just [02:31] the landing page to start? and three [02:33] build step by step asking Chad GPT for [02:35] help at each roadblock. I would of [02:37] course ask him to use modern [02:39] technologies like Nexjs, NodeJS. [02:42] That's awesome. What I really want to [02:43]  [02:43] talk about is ideas and finding [02:45] successful ideas. You have multiple [02:48] successful products and you share with [02:50] me your strategy for how you found [02:52] those. Could you tell me a little bit [02:53] more about that? [02:53] I'm someone a bit lazy and I don't have [02:56] unlimited energy. So I have one rule [02:59] that is really crucial for me is to [03:01] never build something that doesn't [03:02] already exist and isn't already [03:04] successful or at least getting some [03:07] traction. So this way I reduce my chance [03:09] of failure and I increase my chances of [03:12] success. So usually to find products [03:14] idea my number one source of idea is [03:16] Twitter especially around communities [03:19] like solopreneur in the building public [03:21] etc. And then I look for things that are [03:24] working or products that I personally [03:26] like. Here are my four keys filter. [03:28] Number one, I will use it myself. Number [03:30] two, I can see that it already works. [03:32] And three, they are not spending [03:34] thousand on marketing, meaning there is [03:35] a true demand. And four, the product is [03:38] simple enough to maintain. If your [03:40] product passes this filter, then usually [03:42] I'm confident building it. [03:44] Okay, let's go a little bit deeper on [03:45]  [03:47] that. When you come across ideas online, [03:49] what is the actual criteria that you're [03:52] looking at? what are some of the numbers [03:54] and websites and things that you look at [03:56] to know if this is worth building and if [03:58] this is validated. [03:59] So first the most important thing I look [04:01] for traction. Uh the best signal you can [04:04] find on Twitter is when founders share [04:06] their MR screenshot or stripe [04:08] screenshot. Uh I know that sounds basic [04:10] but honestly it's the ultimate proof [04:12] that the tool is working and that people [04:14] are paying for it. Second I analyze how [04:17] they are getting their customers. So I [04:19] use href to check their traffic sources. [04:21] So, are they getting customers only from [04:23] ads or are they also ranking on SEO? If [04:26] they are growing with both ads and SEO, [04:28] that's a very good sign because it shows [04:30] a strong demand and it's usually easier [04:32] to replicate their success. Is they rely [04:34] mostly on SEO? It can be harder because [04:36] SEO takes time, but it's still doable if [04:39] I'm patient. And third, I check if the [04:41] product is technically something I can [04:43] build and maintain easily. I don't want [04:45] to build a product that will make me [04:47] lose sleep maintaining a complex back [04:49] end. Simplicity is very important for [04:50] me. And uh finally I asked myself, do I [04:53] actually like the product? Because [04:55] there's nothing worse than working on a [04:57] product you don't care about. If I don't [04:59] enjoy using it myself, I won't have the [05:01] motivation to keep going longterm. So in [05:04] short, uh traction first, analyze [05:07] traffic sources, check if I can build it [05:09] easily, and make sure I like the [05:10] product. [05:11]  [05:11] That strategy is cool, and it's amazing [05:13] to have it kind of all boiled down, but [05:14] I want to hear how it actually applied [05:16] to your actual apps that you built. How [05:19] did that strategy specifically work? [05:20] So actually the first real app I built [05:23] was usimus and at that time I didn't use [05:26] that strategy and it was a mistake [05:27] because I ended up building an email [05:30] finding tool that have for competitors [05:33] big names like Apollo limb list and [05:35] stuff like that and it was so difficult [05:37] to maintain. So after us I really [05:40] decided to build something that will be [05:42] easier to maintain and that's how I end [05:44] up building story short. So I saw a post [05:47] from a guy building a tool to automate [05:49] posting faceless video on YouTube, Tik [05:51] Tok, etc. And the numbers were crazy. So [05:54] I started to investigate is it hard to [05:56] build and where is the traffic coming [05:58] from? The really good thing with this [06:00] one is all the traffic was from Facebook [06:02] ads which means I can replicate it [06:05] literally in a week because Facebook ads [06:07] you just have to start it and you have [06:09] the traffic. So I went for it. I built [06:11] the tool launched ads and story shorti [06:14] grew very fast. So story short, it was [06:16] 100% the process I described earlier. I [06:19] validated the idea. I saw there a clear [06:21] demand. It was simple product and it was [06:24] a market I was personally interested in. [06:26]  [06:26] All right, before we finish talking [06:28] about how Samuel grew his apps to [06:30] $34,000 per month, let's talk about [06:32] something a lot of solers struggle with. [06:34] Design. You've got a working idea. You [06:37] know it solves a problem, but suddenly [06:39] you've wasted hours taking screenshots [06:41] just to figure out how to make your app [06:43] look good. That's where Mobin comes in. [06:46] Mobin is the world's largest library of [06:49] realworld mobile and web app designs. [06:52] Over 1.7 million people, from Airbnb [06:55] designers to indie devs, use it to find [06:58] inspiration, study flows, and build [07:00] smarter, not slower. You can search [07:03] thousands of actual product screens by [07:05] keyword, flow, or even style. Whether [07:08] you need an onboarding flow, payw wall [07:10] layout, or just a clean signup form, [07:12] Mobin shows you exactly how the best [07:14] apps do it so you don't have to start [07:16] from scratch. Whether you're building [07:18] your first app or your 10th, it's a [07:20] massive timesaver. Just click the first [07:22] link in the description to check out [07:24] Mobin. Thank you to Mobin for sponsoring [07:26] this video. All right, let's get back to [07:28]  [07:28] Samuel. All right, so I mean on that [07:29] note, can you break down the three [07:31] different businesses that you built that [07:33] are all successful? [07:34] Okay, so I built us.com. It's a LinkedIn [07:37] scrapping tool that is making around [07:38] $15,000 per month and has around 10,000 [07:42] customers. I have storyshow.ai, which is [07:44] an AI video generator for Tik Tok and [07:46] YouTube that is making around $20,000 [07:49] per month and has around $4,000 [07:51] customers. And Capacity.so, which is [07:53] brand new. It's an AI coding tool that [07:56] is making currently $900 per month and [07:59] has around 50 users. [08:01] Okay, that's awesome. So we talked about [08:02]  [08:04] the ideas, we talked about the framework [08:06] for finding ideas, let's talk about what [08:08] everyone wants to hear about, which is [08:10] once you find the idea, how do you grow [08:12] the business? What growth strategies are [08:14] you using and how do you know which ones [08:15] to do? [08:16] So I always start by running ads. It's [08:19] always the first thing I do. So I do it [08:21] on Google and meta depending on the [08:23] product. Sometimes it's better on [08:25] Google, sometimes it's better on meta. [08:27] It's the fastest way to validate and [08:28] test the market. And as soon as I get [08:31] some traction with ads, I move to the [08:33] second part of the growth, which is SEO. [08:36] I think too many apps rely only on ads [08:38] and never got a single visitor from [08:40] Google. Of course, SEO takes time, but [08:42] once it works, it's almost free traffic [08:44] and it compounds. I also use faceless [08:47] YouTube channels to grow my apps. I even [08:50] created a feature inside Story Short for [08:52] this. The idea is that story short will [08:54] automatically publish daily UGC style [08:56] video about your product on YouTube [08:59] channels, Tik Tok and Instagram. You can [09:01] create multiple channel that talk about [09:03] your product every day on autopilot. So [09:05] depending on your niche, this can bring [09:07] crazy results over time. It works really [09:09] well. And finally, I do affiliate [09:12] marketing. I did it for all those three [09:13] apps, especially on Story Short. It's a [09:16] super important because not only does it [09:18] bring clients at a fixed cost, but it [09:20] also create virality because I have many [09:22] people doing a YouTube video about story [09:24] short writing articles. So it bring a [09:27] zero results and people are more likely [09:30] to share your product if they earn a [09:31] commission. So in short to my grow stack [09:33] is one start with ads. Two build SEO as [09:37] soon as there's traction three use [09:39] faceless YouTube channel to drive [09:40] attention on also on Tik Tok and [09:42] Instagram. And four run an affiliate [09:45] program to boost virality and get [09:47] customers at a fixed price. [09:49]  [09:49] All right cool. Well on a similar note [09:50] let's talk about tech stack. I know you [09:52] don't come from a software engineering [09:54] background but what stack do you build [09:56] your apps in and how do you deploy [09:58] these? So all my apps are built with [10:01] NexJS and NodeJS for the coding part. I [10:04] use Href for the SEO analysis and I use [10:08] also AI tools for writing articles. So [10:11] for the SEO so I was using SEO which is [10:14] really great but now I just switched to [10:16] a new one called outrank.so. It really [10:18] automates the writing of article posted [10:21] automatically on your blog and I use [10:23] Versel for deploying my apps, Stripe for [10:26] payments and yeah that's it. That was [10:28] great. On a similar note, people who are [10:29]  [10:29] watching are probably wondering, "Okay, [10:31] you're telling us how much money your [10:32] business is making, but what's the [10:34] profit? What's the cost to run this [10:35] business and how profitable are these?" [10:37] Well, us cost me around $4,000 per [10:41] month. And story short, cost me around [10:43] $5,000 per month. So, it cost a bit less [10:46] than us because Artimis you have to run [10:49] instances to automate many things. So, [10:51] it's quite expensive. And capacity, I [10:54] can't tell yet, but it will be quite [10:56] expensive because we have to run [10:57] instances to deploy a website each time. [11:00] Cool. You built a bunch of successful [11:02]  [11:02] businesses. Some things have worked, [11:04] some things haven't. What did you learn [11:06] while building those businesses that [11:07] surprised you? [11:08] What really surprised me uh is that you [11:11] don't need to innovate. You just need to [11:13] see what is working on ex in [11:15] communities, on forums, and build your [11:17] own alternative, your own version of a [11:19] product. If you like the product and see [11:21] that it's working, just clone the idea, [11:23] build an MVP in two weeks and launch ads [11:25] immediately. I think people are always [11:28] over complicated this uh but simple [11:30] boring tools are what makes the most of [11:32] money I think. [11:33] Great. And last question that we ask [11:34]  [11:35] everyone who comes onto the channel, if [11:37] you could go back in time and stand on [11:39] Samuel's shoulder when you were an [11:41] optitian, what advice would you give him [11:43] to get started to build apps and make [11:45] money online? My first advice would be [11:47] of course to use AI coding tools. At [11:50] that time there was no coding tool but [11:52] today you can use so many AI coding [11:54] tools that I think that I wouldn't have [11:56] learned to code. Two would be spend time [11:58] learning Google ads and meta even X ads [12:01] and there are many ads you can learn. [12:03] Three launch as soon as possible. Skip [12:05] the boring parts of building a SAS like [12:07] the password reset pages setting pages. [12:10] Just launch the minimal basic products [12:12] and run ads to test demand right away. [12:15] Once you get traction, focus on SEO. It [12:17] will bring a compounding free traffic [12:19] over time. And even if one day you want [12:21] to sell the tool, having SEO traffic is [12:24] also very valuable. And automate as much [12:26] as you can use automation tools. So like [12:29] outrank, story short, etc. to automate [12:31] posting, article creation, as much as [12:34] you can. Finally, once you have growth [12:37] and customers coming daily, I would [12:39] finish the product, bring new feature, [12:41] etc. [12:42] All right. Well, that's great advice. I [12:43] love your strategy. I love the business [12:45] that you're building. Thank you for [12:46] coming on the channel, Samuel. And I [12:48] hope everyone watching this learned [12:50] something and you're going to build cool [12:51] stuff because of it. Thanks for coming [12:53] on. [12:53] Thanks, bud. [12:54] I love Samuel's story because it goes to [12:55]  [12:57] show that you don't need to invent a [12:58] brand new idea. You can go find [13:00] something that's already working and [13:02] just make it a little bit better. With [13:04] the right process and the right [13:05] approach, anybody can build something [13:08] successful. And inside Starter Story [13:10] Build, we'll show you how to build apps [13:12] the right way. In just 2 weeks, you'll [13:14] find an idea, build it with AI, and ship [13:17] it out into the world. Over 1,000 people [13:19] have already joined and shipped their [13:21] first apps. So, if you want to finally [13:23] bring your idea to life, head to the [13:25] link in the description and check out [13:27] Starter Story Build. Thank you guys for [13:29] watching. We'll see you in the next one. [13:31] Peace.
