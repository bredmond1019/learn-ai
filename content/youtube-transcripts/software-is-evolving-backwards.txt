[00:00] the other day I opened Microsoft Excel [00:02] and found this a little copilot button [00:04] that hovers over any cell that I [00:06] highlight and I immediately hated it not [00:09] only does it cover up whatever is [00:10] underneath it it also kind of fades in [00:12] and out depending on where I move the [00:14] cursor and as you can see here in this [00:16] slow motion shot there's also a clearer [00:18] lag between me clicking on something and [00:20] the co-pilot button actually moving the [00:22] delay is even different between each [00:24] click just to make things extra annoying [00:26] so this button is wildly distracting and [00:28] it's also of course completely redundant [00:30] because there already is a giant [00:32] co-pilot button in the ribbon if you [00:34] wanted to invoke the AI assistant in a [00:37] general and if you wanted to do [00:38] something specific to a cell it's also [00:40] already in the context menu when you [00:42] right click on a cell and of course the [00:43] Copilot app was pinned to the taskbar by [00:46] default too and since I have a C-pilot [00:48] Plus PC I also have a feature called [00:50] click to-do which opens C-pilot to [00:52] analyze what is on my screen and to [00:54] perform actions on it plus if all of [00:56] that was somehow not enough I also got a [00:58] physical co-pilot button on my keyboard [01:01] so this new floating button that just [01:03] appeared in Excel for me was the sixth [01:05] and perhaps the most distracting way [01:07] that Microsoft has found to push copilot [01:09] into my workflow but I bet it won't be [01:11] the last one now as a tech YouTuber I [01:14] don't want to become the old man yelling [01:15] at cloud whenever a new technology [01:17] appears so I was ready to move on but [01:19] then that same day I opened Notion in my [01:21] browser and I saw this four different [01:24] floating AI buttons on my screen at the [01:26] same time including both above and below [01:29] my cursor making it very hard for me to [01:31] actually see what I was doing and [01:32] ridiculously easy to accidentally [01:34] trigger one now three of these I've [01:36] known for a while because they're from [01:37] Notion itself and I find them only [01:39] mildly annoying but then this fourth [01:41] button was actually new and somehow even [01:43] more disruptive as it's literally one [01:45] pixel away from where I'm pointing my [01:46] cursor at and it took me a while to [01:48] realize that it was actually Firefox my [01:50] web browser that placed it here if I add [01:52] the usual C-pilot things on top of that [01:53] too then now Notion Firefox and Windows [01:56] have collectively added uh I think seven [01:59] ways of invoking three different AI [02:01] assistants onto my workflow i think you [02:02] don't even have to be a grand AI hater [02:04] to think that something is fundamentally [02:06] wrong here and in fact it reminds me [02:07] very much of two things from my [02:09] childhood first there's Clippy of course [02:11] much of this is obviously way too [02:12] prominent then notion even has an [02:14] animated face that I bet is customd [02:16] designed to distract me just like Clippy [02:18] was but then second I'm also reminded of [02:20] browser bars do you remember those for [02:22] those of you who are perhaps too young [02:24] or too old to remember these companies [02:26] used to sneakily extol extensions that [02:28] supposedly added extra functionality to [02:30] your web browser but in reality just [02:32] acted as promotional vehicles for their [02:34] services even though you didn't really [02:36] ask for them and the way that now every [02:38] month or so a new AI button appears in [02:40] my workflow feels exactly like that [02:42] especially since Microsoft and Notion [02:44] both charge money for their services [02:46] while Mozilla presumably wants to make [02:48] money through eventually having a [02:49] revenue sharing agreement with their AI [02:51] provider just like they have with Google [02:54] most of these buttons are added to my [02:55] workflow not because I asked for them [02:56] but because the company wants to sell me [02:58] a product and now I have to find a way [03:00] to turn most of them off if I don't want [03:02] them now Firefox at least makes theirs [03:04] pretty easy right here but with notion [03:06] for example I would have to contact [03:08] their support team and ask them to turn [03:10] it off manually which is absolutely [03:12] bonkers while Microsoft at least [03:13] partially lets you turn co-pilot off but [03:15] then they also have a very long history [03:17] of just turning features back on later [03:19] at a random time i find all of this [03:21] pretty infuriating and by the looks of [03:23] it I'm not alone [03:26] [Music] [03:29] now I have plenty more infuriating [03:31] examples that I want to show you but [03:32] before that I want to make clear that [03:34] I'm not inherently an AI hater for [03:36] example multiple times now I recorded [03:38] audio with the wrong microphone like in [03:39] this case my smartphone and then Adobe's [03:42] voice AI magically fixed that audio and [03:44] made it completely usable for a YouTube [03:46] video that's great or I also love the AI [03:49] features of my video editing software Da [03:50] Vinci Resolve which allows me to make [03:52] for example magic mask cutouts that I [03:54] literally would not be able to do in any [03:56] other way i also recently messed up my [03:58] finger pretty badly and so for this very [03:59] video I used Samsung's voice recorder [04:01] app to do my usual ideiation in instead [04:03] of typing things out and the app did [04:05] transcriptions and some reason and it [04:07] even found a pretty funny title for one [04:08] of my recordings ubiquitous AI [04:10] integration a digital plague that's good [04:13] some of AI is very good and I even pay [04:15] for some of these solutions but all of [04:17] these were a actually useful features [04:19] and b also things that I told the [04:21] machine to do not things that the [04:22] machine injected into my workflow being [04:25] interrupted with useless recommendations [04:27] is the thing that I want to complain [04:28] about in this video and it's something [04:29] that seems to be really annoying many of [04:31] you as well i posted on my social media [04:33] channels to see if all of you had [04:34] similarly annoying experiences as well [04:36] and yeah you gave loads of really [04:38] horrible examples the most consistent [04:40] complaints that I got by far were for [04:41] Microsoft Office and I could definitely [04:43] see why i opened Word for the first time [04:45] in a while on my laptop and the default [04:47] experience was immediately insane [04:50] without even doing anything the app [04:51] launches on a distracting animation that [04:53] pushes the page down and adds four [04:55] different text boxes on top on my laptop [04:58] these boxes together with the ribbon and [05:00] all the other taskbars typically leave [05:01] me with something like 30 maybe 40% of [05:04] the screen being used for my actual [05:06] document at most oh and of course these [05:08] are also on top of a giant co-pilot [05:10] button in the ribbon and once I start [05:12] writing there's also a co-pilot button [05:14] hovering on the side just for good [05:16] measure it is also of course in the [05:18] context menu and when I delete that Word [05:20] also helpfully points out that I can [05:22] press Alt + I to draft with Copilot i [05:25] mean what the hell but if you thought [05:27] that is bad somehow Outlook is even [05:29] worse opening the app on my phone [05:31] immediately greeted me with a full [05:32] screen Copilot pop-up and I got the same [05:34] on my desktop too because Outlook for [05:36] some reason really needed to tell me [05:38] that Copilot can generate themes for my [05:41] email client to add Zing to my mailbox [05:44] full screen pop-ups are about the most [05:46] disruptive things an app can do to a [05:48] user and they decided that co-pilot [05:50] generated themes would be worth that how [05:53] anyway once I'm past that pop-up I open [05:55] the first email in my inbox and I get a [05:57] co-pilot button that lets me reply to or [06:00] summarize the email and like uh the [06:02] first email I opened was an automatic [06:04] email from one drive telling me about a [06:06] file that was shared with me and I [06:08] really don't know what you'd reply to [06:10] that or what there's to be summarized [06:11] but hey Microsoft also put a whole bar [06:14] on top which says summary by copilot [06:16] let's see what this does well after a [06:18] solid 19 seconds of waiting which I've [06:21] sped up the summary says Maya shared a [06:23] document titled document with you via a [06:26] link that works for everyone it's all so [06:28] dumb like why does Microsoft feel the [06:30] need to summarize an email that it [06:32] itself sent which it should know it [06:34] doesn't need a summary like at least of [06:36] your own things why are there two [06:38] buttons for summarizing this thing it's [06:40] also bad now people have complained [06:42] about the Gemini doing weird things in [06:44] Google Workspace as well i don't [06:45] actually pay for Gemini myself but [06:47] Tristan does and he found a solid nine [06:49] Gemini buttons on screen on his Google [06:51] Drive which he then clicked on just to [06:53] consistently be told the Gemini is still [06:55] learning and can't help him with that [06:57] okay it's a good thing Google put I [06:59] repeat nine buttons on the page for that [07:02] i mean I guess this is probably just [07:03] some short-term bug will get ironed out [07:05] in a day or two but this is so [07:07] indicative of how all of these rollouts [07:09] seem to me to a user the first priority [07:11] is just to disrupt me by putting all of [07:14] the buttons everywhere and then actually [07:16] making any of this work can become [07:17] useful well that's like priority number [07:19] 40 and actually AI wanting to summarize [07:22] everything even things that don't make [07:23] sense to summarize is one of the core [07:25] frustrations that I've heard from many [07:26] of my viewers my viewer Kate says that [07:29] she uses an app called ProQuest [07:31] Dissertations and Thesis Global and that [07:33] program wants to summarize everything [07:35] including the titles of documents so [07:37] from the title evaluating knowledge and [07:39] attitudes towards deni fever and its [07:41] vaccination among medical staff in China [07:43] a questionnaire-based study the program [07:45] decided to summarize that and say this [07:47] document provides valuable insights into [07:49] the current state of knowledge and [07:50] aptitudes towards deni fever and [07:52] vaccination among medical staff in China [07:55] that is obviously just rewarding things [07:56] and taking out random details and who [07:59] the hell thought that summarizing titles [08:01] made sense in the first place better yet [08:03] Kate says that this feature can't be [08:04] turned off until a software update is [08:06] released now perhaps an even more [08:08] outrageous complaint I got was from [08:10] Xiaomi users who claimed that when you [08:12] highlight text on a Xiaomi phone now an [08:14] AI button has taken the place of the [08:15] copy button which was instead moved to [08:18] be under the three dot menu i'm not a [08:20] Xiaomi user myself so I fired up a [08:22] Xiaomi phone to do some quick testing [08:23] and indeed this does seem to be the case [08:25] at least sometimes depending on the [08:27] context and which app you're in [08:28] sometimes the highlights have the copy [08:30] buttons and sometimes they do not in [08:32] fact a lot of the useful options get put [08:34] in the overflow menu but the AI option [08:36] never does and I think this actually [08:38] highlights part of the problem with all [08:39] of these AI features every time you [08:42] prominently place a new AI feature into [08:44] a UI it has to come at the expense of [08:46] something that was already there and was [08:48] presumably useful already like for [08:49] example the copy button in this case [08:51] anyway and the last example that I [08:53] wanted to highlight from all of my [08:54] viewer comments are all the AI buttons [08:56] from Meta no matter if in WhatsApp [08:58] Instagram or on Facebook i got tons of [09:00] comments about these being really [09:02] annoying and just really in the way fun [09:04] fact I randomly opened my WhatsApp to [09:06] try it out and I apparently have a chat [09:08] history with Meta AI about uh Sya Uno [09:12] lottery results today from April earlier [09:15] this year i have zero idea what this is [09:17] i have no memory of having ever asked [09:19] Meta about what appeared to be blotty [09:21] results from Colombia and from what I [09:23] can tell this perfectly sums up Meta AI [09:26] just a box you can't disable that you [09:28] apparently click on by accident plenty [09:30] of people have pointed out in their [09:31] comments that this kind of clippy 2.0 [09:33] user experience is one of the things [09:35] that is actually pushing more people [09:36] towards Linux and Libra Office and [09:39] whatever and while I think change is [09:41] slow it definitely might be a breaking [09:43] point for some still I have two leading [09:45] theories for why all these tech [09:46] companies seem to be so hellbent on in [09:48] shitifying their products right now even [09:49] if it might cost them some users first I [09:52] don't work in a tech company anymore but [09:54] I've heard the exact same thing from all [09:55] of my friends who still do a bunch of [09:57] the shareholders in their companies [09:58] heard about AI being a big deal they [10:01] panicked that they might be missing out [10:02] on something so they told their [10:04] company's board that they must go big on [10:05] it the board told the management the [10:07] management told the product people and [10:09] congratulations it's now everyone's [10:10] primary job in the organization to build [10:12] AI features now normally the product [10:15] people would first identify either a [10:16] user need or a business goal and then [10:18] decide on the appropriate technology to [10:20] meet that need but here everything is [10:22] working the other way around a [10:24] technology was selected first and then [10:26] the product people are tasked to find [10:27] user problems that they could [10:28] potentially solve with it now this of [10:30] course is basically insane but there's [10:32] so much pressure from above and from [10:33] outside and everywhere that a lot of my [10:35] friends at work now get essentially [10:36] measured at work by how much AI they can [10:39] cram into everything whether it makes [10:40] sense or not and second many companies [10:42] seem to think that there is a genuine AI [10:44] race right now and they have to compete [10:46] and be fast before your habits and [10:48] workflows get formed and this is more [10:50] important being fast it is than being [10:52] perfect see in my example of notion if I [10:55] wanted to use AI for whatever reason [10:57] where in the software stack would that [10:58] AI live on the application level like [11:01] with notion where it can be very [11:02] specific to my task and also know the [11:04] context of all my other notion documents [11:06] or perhaps in my browser like Firefox [11:08] where it would be a bit more generic but [11:10] maybe it would have context from the [11:11] rest of the web and from other things [11:12] that I do in the browser too or maybe it [11:14] should live on the operating system [11:15] level like on Windows so it can support [11:17] all the apps that I use on my computer [11:19] i'll most likely not need AI on all [11:21] three levels simultaneously but I might [11:23] also not be stuck in my ways yet and so [11:25] the companies are right now racing to [11:26] establish themselves as the default [11:28] which they hope the users will actually [11:30] stick with long term if there really is [11:32] such a race then all of these pop-ups [11:33] and buttons they're not accidents [11:35] they're signs of a war these companies [11:36] are trying to elbow each other out of [11:38] the way so they can be the one that [11:39] actually survives now in this video I [11:42] specifically only focused on how AI [11:43] breaks the user experience not also [11:46] other things but of course AI could also [11:48] break things like copyright trust in [11:49] news work society in general etc those [11:52] are topics that long-term are probably [11:54] going to be even bigger issues and [11:55] today's sponsor 80,000 hours has [11:57] actually been researching and writing [11:59] about these kinds of issues for nearly a [12:00] decade and they have tons of in-depth [12:02] material on their site that you can read [12:04] like what an AI caused existential [12:06] catastrophe could actually look like and [12:08] if just reading about this isn't enough [12:09] for you then they've also found fields [12:11] that you could actually work on to [12:12] contribute to make sure that things go [12:14] well like AI safety technical research [12:16] or AI governance and policy these are [12:19] both areas that 80,000 hours has [12:21] identified as being particularly [12:22] impactful they are a nonprofit that says [12:24] the 80,000 hours the average person will [12:27] spend working is probably the most [12:28] meaningful resource for making the world [12:30] a better place and so choosing to work [12:32] on important problems at work is [12:34] extremely meaningful they could help you [12:36] find career paths that would do good and [12:38] they found that the ones that I've [12:39] already mentioned to be particularly [12:40] impactful 80,000 hours covers many areas [12:42] beyond AI2 of course from pandemic [12:45] preparedness to nuclear war animal [12:46] welfare climate change and more and they [12:48] make all of their advice and research [12:50] available on their site for free they [12:52] even have a podcast where they have [12:53] conversations with experts in these [12:54] fields across nearly 150 episodes if [12:57] that sounds interesting you can get a [12:58] copy of 80,000 hours's career guide [13:01] which distills their most important [13:02] research into one volume for free at [13:04] 80,000 hours.org/techalar [13:07] that link is also down in the [13:09] description that's a great place to [13:10] start and if you're wondering everything [13:11] that they offer is for free because they [13:13] are nonprofit so check them out at [13:15] 80,000our.org/techalar [13:17] to get started and I'll see you next [13:18] Friday
