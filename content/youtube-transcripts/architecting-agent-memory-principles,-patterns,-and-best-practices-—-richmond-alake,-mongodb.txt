[00:01] [Music]

[00:10] [Music] [00:15] in the next 10 to 15 minutes here's uh I [00:18] guess my promise to you i'm going to [00:20] give you some information [00:23] that will be high level there will be [00:26] some practical component to it but this [00:29] information I'll give you within the [00:31] next 6 months will be very relevant and [00:34] it will put you in the best position to [00:36] build the best AI applications to build [00:39] the best agents that are believable [00:41] capable and reliable [00:43] i know we we going to get there [00:48] you know what just for you there we go [00:51] you're welcome so we're going to be [00:52] talking about a memory um [00:56] we're going to be talking [00:57] about the stateless applications that [01:00] we're bu building today and how we can [01:02] make them stateful we're going to be [01:04] talking about the prompt engineering [01:06] that we're doing today and how we can [01:07] reduce that by focusing on persistence [01:11] we're going to be turning the responses [01:13] in our AI application and making our [01:16] agents build relationship with our [01:18] customers and all of it is going to be [01:21] centered around memory [01:24] so I'm going to do a very quick [01:28] evolution of what we've been seeing for [01:29] the past two to three years [01:33] we started off with chat bots lmn power [01:35] chatbots they were great chat GPT came [01:37] out November 2022 and yeah exploded then [01:42] we went into rag we gave this chat bots [01:45] more domain specific relevant knowledge [01:46] and it gave us more personalized [01:48] responses then we begin to scale the [01:51] compute the data we're giving to the [01:54] LLMs and they gave us emerging [01:55] capabilities right reasoning uh tool use [01:59] now we're in the world of AI agents and [02:01] agentic systems [02:04] and the big debate is what is an agent [02:07] right what is an AI agent i don't like [02:09] to go into that debate because that's [02:11] like asking what is consciousness [02:14] um is a spectrum the agenticity and [02:18] that's a word now agenticity [02:21] of uh of an agent is is a spectrum so [02:25] they're different levels [02:27] I came here and I saw Whimo and to me [02:30] was pure sorcery we don't have that in [02:32] the UK and they're different levels of [02:34] um self-driving so you can look at the [02:36] genetic spectrum in that respect we have [02:39] a minimal agent whereas an LLM running [02:41] the loop great then you have a level [02:44] four is autonomous agent a bunch of [02:46] agents that have access to tools you [02:48] they can do whatever they want they're [02:50] not prompted in any way or a minimal way [02:53] but this is how I see things is a [02:55] spectrum so what is an AI agent it's a [02:59] computational entity with awareness of [03:01] his environment through perception [03:03] cognitive abilities through an LLM and [03:06] also can take action through tool use [03:08] but the most important bit is there is [03:10] some form of memory short-term or [03:13] long-term [03:15] memory is important it's important [03:17] because we're trying to make our agents [03:18] reflective interactive proactive and [03:21] reactive and autonomous and every most [03:24] of this if not all can be solved with [03:28] memory [03:30] um I work at MongoDB and we're going to [03:32] make we're going to connect the dots [03:34] don't worry so this is all nice and good [03:37] this is what what you look at if you um [03:39] double click into one AI agent is but [03:41] the most important bit to me is I'll go [03:44] slide people are taking pictures sorry [03:47] all right let's go the most important [03:49] bit is memory and when we talk about [03:50] memory the easy way you can think about [03:52] it is short-term long-term but there al [03:55] other distinct forms right um [03:57] conversational entity memory knowledge [03:59] data store cache working memory we're [04:01] going to be talking about all of that [04:02] today so these are the high level [04:04] concepts [04:06] but let me go a little bit metal [04:08] why we're all here um today in this [04:12] conference is because of AI right we're [04:15] all architects of intelligence the whole [04:17] point of AI is to build some form of [04:18] computational entity that surpasses [04:20] human intelligence or mimics it then AGI [04:25] we're focused on making that [04:27] intelligence surpass humans in all tasks [04:30] we can think of and if you think about [04:33] the most intelligent humans you know [04:36] what determines the intelligence is [04:37] their ability to recall it's their [04:39] memory so if we if AI or AGI is meant to [04:42] mimic human intelligence is a no-brainer [04:45] no pun intended that we need memory [04:48] within the agents that we're building [04:50] today does anyone disagree [04:53] good i would have kicked you out um okay [04:56] let's go so humans you in your brain [04:58] right now you have these you have this [05:00] this is not what it looks like but it's [05:02] close enough you have different forms of [05:04] memory and that's what makes you [05:06] intelligent that's what makes you retain [05:08] some of the information I'm going to be [05:09] giving you today there is short-term [05:11] long-term working memory semantic [05:13] episodic procedural memory um in your [05:16] brain right now there is something [05:18] called a cerebellum i always get the [05:20] word wrong but that's where you store [05:22] most of the routines and skills you can [05:24] do can anyone here do a backflip [05:27] really wow you just see my excitement um [05:32] your the information or the knowledge of [05:34] that bat flip is actually stored in that [05:36] part of your brain so I heard it's 90% [05:39] confidence by the way [05:41] that is actually it is right i'm not [05:44] going to do one but but it's stored in [05:46] that part of your brain now you can [05:48] actually mimic this in agents and I'm [05:51] going to show you how but now we're [05:53] talking about agent memory [05:56] agent memory is the mechanisms that we [06:00] are implementing to actually make sure [06:03] that states persist in our AI [06:06] application [06:08] our agents are able to accumulate [06:10] information turn data into memory and [06:12] have it inform the next ex execution [06:15] step but the goal is to make them more [06:18] reliable believable and capable [06:22] those are the key things [06:25] and the core topic that we are going to [06:27] be working on as AI memory engineers is [06:32] on memory management we're going to be [06:34] building memory management systems and [06:37] memory management is a systematic [06:39] process of organizing all the [06:41] information that you're putting into the [06:42] context window yes we have like large [06:45] context window but that's not for you to [06:46] stuff all your data in that's for you to [06:50] pull in the relevant memory and [06:52] structure them in a way that is [06:53] effective that allows for the response [06:56] um to be relevant [06:58] so these are the core components of [07:00] memory management generation storage [07:02] retrieval integration updating deletion [07:06] there's a lie here because you you don't [07:09] delete memories humans don't delete [07:10] their memories except traumatic one and [07:12] you want to forget but we really should [07:15] be looking at implementing forgetting [07:17] mechanisms within the memory management [07:20] systems that we're building you don't [07:21] want to delete memories and a different [07:23] research papers are looking at how to [07:25] implement some form of forgetting within [07:27] agents [07:29] but the most important bit is retrieval [07:32] and I'm getting to the MongoDB part [07:35] this moving around um this is rag it's [07:39] very simple right because we've been [07:41] doing it as AI engineers um MongoDB [07:46] is that one database that is core to rag [07:49] pipelines because it gives you all the [07:50] retrieval mechanisms rag is not just [07:52] vector vector search is not all you need [07:55] you need other type of search and we [07:57] have that with MongoDB anything you can [07:59] think of you're going to be hearing a [08:00] lot about MongoDB in this um in this [08:03] conference today but this is what rag is [08:05] and you level up you go into the world [08:08] of agentic rag right you give the [08:11] retrieval capability to the agent as a [08:14] tool and now we can choose when to call [08:17] on information [08:19] there's a lot going on i I'll send this [08:21] somehow to you guys or you can come to [08:23] me and I'll um LinkedIn it to you add me [08:26] on LinkedIn [08:28] and just ask for the slice and I'll send [08:30] it to you richmond on LinkedIn um this [08:34] is memory [08:36] mongodb [08:38] is the memory provider for Aentic [08:40] systems and when you understand that we [08:43] provide the developer the AI memory [08:46] engineer the AI engineer all the [08:48] features that they need to turn data [08:52] into memory to make the agents [08:53] believable capable and reliable you [08:56] begin to understand the importance of [08:57] having a technology partner like MongoDB [09:01] on your AI stack [09:03] so these are this is the same um image [09:07] but just a bit more focused and not a [09:09] different memory so I'm going to skip [09:10] through this slide because I go into a [09:11] bit of detail um I'm also going to give [09:14] you a library i'm working on an open [09:17] source library i'm ashamed of the name i [09:20] was trying to be cool when I came up [09:21] with it it's called Memoriz [09:23] um [09:24] you can type that on Google you'll find [09:26] it but it has all the design patterns of [09:29] all of this memory that I'm showing you [09:31] for this memory types and that I will [09:33] show you as well but there are different [09:35] forms of memory and AI agents and how we [09:37] make them work so let's start with [09:38] persona who's is anyone here from open [09:41] AI [09:43] leave i'm joking um well a couple a [09:47] couple months ago right so they they [09:49] gave chat GBT a bit of personality right [09:53] um and they didn't do a good job but [09:57] they are going in the right direction [09:59] which is we are trying to make our [10:01] systems more believable right we're [10:03] trying to make them more human we're [10:04] trying to make them create relationship [10:06] with the consumer with the users of our [10:09] systems persona memory helps with that [10:12] and you can model that in MongoD DB [10:15] right this is memories you if you spin [10:18] up the library it helps you um spin up [10:21] all of this um different type of memory [10:23] types so this is persona um I have a [10:25] little demo if we have time um [10:29] but this is persona memory this is what [10:30] it will look like in MongoDB then [10:32] there's toolbox [10:34] um the guidance from OpenAI is you [10:38] should only put uh the schema of maybe [10:41] 10 to 21 tools in the context window but [10:45] when you use your database as a toolbox [10:48] where you're storing the JSON schema of [10:50] your tools in MongoDB you can scale [10:53] because just before you hit the LLM you [10:57] can just get the relevant tool using any [10:59] form of search so that's toolbox that's [11:03] me that's a toolbox memory and that's [11:05] what it would look like right you would [11:06] store all this is how you model it in uh [11:09] MongoDB you store all the information of [11:11] your JSON schema now you'll begin to [11:13] understand that MongoDB gives you that [11:16] flexible data model the document data [11:19] model is very flexible it can adapt to [11:21] wherever data wherever model you want [11:23] your data to take wherever structure and [11:25] you have all of the retrieval [11:26] capabilities graph vector text [11:29] geospatial query [11:31] in one database [11:33] conversation memory is a bit obvious [11:35] right back and forth conversation with [11:37] uh chat GPT with Claude you can store [11:39] that in your database as well in MongoDB [11:43] as conversational memory and this is [11:44] what that would look like time stamp [11:46] time stamp and you have a conversation [11:48] ID and you can see something there [11:51] called recall recency and associate [11:53] conversation ID and that's my attempt at [11:55] implementing some memory signals um but [11:58] and that's goes into the forgetting [12:00] mechanism that I'm trying to implement [12:02] in my very famous library memories um [12:06] I'm going to go through the next slides [12:08] a bit quicker because I want to get to [12:09] the end of this [12:12] workflow memory is very important you [12:14] build your agentic system they execute a [12:16] certain step step one step two step [12:17] three it fails but one thing you could [12:20] do is the failure is experience it's [12:22] learning experience you can store that [12:24] in your database i see you nodding [12:25] you're like "Yeah." um you can store [12:27] that in your database and you can then [12:29] pull that in in the next execution to [12:32] inform the LLM to not take this step or [12:35] explore other paths you can store that [12:37] in MongoDB as well you can model that [12:40] because what you have with MongoDB is [12:42] that memory provider for your agentic [12:43] system and that's what this is what that [12:45] looks like when you model it an example [12:47] of it anyway so we have episodic memory [12:50] we have long-term memory we have an [12:51] agent registry you can store the [12:53] information of your agent as well um and [12:56] this is how I do it uh you can see the [12:58] agent has tools persona all the good [13:00] stuff there's entity memory as well so [13:03] there's different forms of memory and [13:06] the memory the memoriz library is very [13:08] experimental and educational but it it [13:10] encapsulates some of the memory and [13:12] implementation and design patterns that [13:15] I'm thinking of on an everyday basis [13:18] that we're thinking of in MongoDB so [13:20] MongoDB you probably get the point now [13:23] the memory provider for Agent Tech [13:25] systems there are tools out there that [13:27] focus on memory management um MEGPT ME [13:30] Zero Zep they're great tools but after [13:35] speaking to some of you folks and some [13:37] of our partners and customers here there [13:39] is not there is there is not one way to [13:42] solve memory and you need a memory [13:45] provider to build your custom solution [13:48] to make sure the memory management [13:50] systems that you're able to implement [13:51] are effective so we really understand [13:56] the importance of managing data and [13:58] managing memory and that's why earlier [14:01] this year we acquired Voyage AI now they [14:04] create the best [14:06] no offense open AI embedding models in [14:09] the market today voyage AI embedded [14:11] models are we have a text multimodel we [14:16] have re-rankers and this allows you to [14:19] really solve the problem or at least [14:21] reduce AI hall elucination within your [14:23] rag and aentic systems and what we're [14:26] doing and what we're focused on the [14:27] mission for MongoDB is to make the [14:30] developer more productive by taking away [14:32] the considerations and all the concerns [14:35] around managing different data and all [14:38] the process of chunking in retrieval [14:41] strategies we we pull that into the [14:43] database we are redefining the database [14:46] and that's why in a few months we're [14:48] going to be pulling in Voyage AI the [14:50] embedded models and the rerankers into [14:52] MongoDB Atlas and you will not have to [14:55] be writing chunking strategies for your [14:59] um for your data i see a lot of people [15:01] nodding yeah that's good so MongoDB is a [15:04] is a household name to be honest with um [15:07] I watched MongoDB IPO back when back [15:09] when I was in university i bought the [15:11] stocks when I was in university um free [15:14] just free i already had about £100 um I [15:18] was broke but [15:20] we are very focused and we take it very [15:23] seriously making sure that you guys can [15:25] build the best AI products AI features [15:28] very quickly in a secure way so MongoDB [15:31] is built for the change that we are [15:32] going to experience now tomorrow in the [15:35] next couple years i want to end with [15:37] this you know who these two guys are [15:41] damn okay this is Hob and Wiso they won [15:44] a Nobel Prize um in the late 90s but [15:47] they did some research on the visual [15:49] cortex of cats um they experimented with [15:52] cats that this probably wouldn't fly now [15:54] but back in the 50s and 60s things were [15:57] a bit more relaxed but they found out [15:59] that the visual cortex of the brains [16:02] between cats and humans actually worked [16:04] by learning different hierarchies of [16:07] representation so edges contours and [16:10] abstract shapes now people that are in [16:12] deep learning would know that this is [16:14] how convol convolutional neural network [16:15] works and the research that these guy [16:19] these guys did inspired and informed [16:22] convolutional neural networks that's [16:24] face detection object detection it's it [16:27] all comes from neuroscience so we are [16:30] architects of intelligence but there is [16:32] a better architect of intelligence it's [16:34] nature nature's created our brains it's [16:38] the most effective form of intelligence [16:39] and well some humans that I meet but [16:41] it's the most effective form of [16:43] intelligence that we have today and we [16:45] could look inwards to build this agentic [16:47] system so last week Saturday myself and [16:51] Tenu is the chief AI scientist at [16:53] MongoDB also the founder of Voyage AI we [16:56] sat with this three guys in the middle [16:58] are neuroscientists kenneth has been [17:00] exploring human brain and memory for [17:03] over 20 years and and over here is [17:06] Charles Parker he's the creator of MEGPT [17:08] your letter and we are having these [17:10] conversation and once again we're [17:12] mirroring how we're bringing [17:14] neuroscientists and application [17:17] developers together to solve and push us [17:21] on the path of AGI so that's my talk [17:23] done check out memories and you can come [17:25] talk to me about memory add me on [17:27] LinkedIn if you want this presentation [17:29] thank you for your time [17:35] [Music]
