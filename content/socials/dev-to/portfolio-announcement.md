Are you ready to move beyond basic chatbots and build AI systems that can actually think, plan, and act? I'm thrilled to introduce **Learn Agentic AI** - a completely free, bilingual platform designed to take you from AI curious to AI capable.

## üåç Visit the Platform

- **English**: [www.learn-agentic-ai.com/en/](https://www.learn-agentic-ai.com/en/)
- **Portuguese**: [www.learn-agentic-ai.com/pt-BR/](https://www.learn-agentic-ai.com/pt-BR/)

## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI represents the next evolution in artificial intelligence - systems that don't just respond to prompts but actively work toward goals, make decisions, and interact with multiple tools and services. Think of it as the difference between a calculator (reactive) and a financial advisor (agentic).

## üéØ What You'll Find

### Free Learning Paths

The platform offers four comprehensive learning paths, each designed for different skill levels and goals:

#### 1. **AI Systems Introduction** (5 hours)

- Building your first MCP server
- Creating intelligent agents
- Real-world business applications

#### 2. **MCP Fundamentals** (4 hours)
Master the Model Context Protocol - the backbone of modern AI integrations.

- MCP architecture deep dive
- Implementing resources and tools
- Building production-ready servers

## üí° What Makes This Different?

### 1. **Truly Free**
No paywalls, no "premium" content, no email gates. Every resource is freely accessible because I believe AI education should be democratized.

### 2. **Bilingual Support**
Full content available in both English and Portuguese, making AI education accessible to over 260 million Portuguese speakers worldwide.

### 3. **Practical Focus**
Instead of abstract theory, every module includes:
- Working code examples
- Real business scenarios
