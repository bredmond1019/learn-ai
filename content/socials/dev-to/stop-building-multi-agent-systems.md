Ever tried building a multi-agent system that actually works in production? Yeah, me too. After hundreds of hours of pain, I finally found an article that explains why we've all been doing it wrong.

## The Multi-Agent Trap 🪤

Cognition AI (the geniuses behind Devon) just dropped some truth bombs about multi-agent systems. Here's the shocking reality:

**Popular frameworks like OpenAI Swarm, Microsoft Autogen, and CrewAI are pushing architectures that almost never work in production.**

I learned this the hard way building my AI startup. More agents = More problems. Every. Single. Time.

## Two Principles That Changed Everything 💡

### Principle 1: Share Context
Every agent needs the FULL context. Not summaries. Not filtered views. Everything.

### Principle 2: Actions Carry Implicit Decisions  
When agents act without seeing what others are doing, they make conflicting assumptions. Game over.

## The Architecture That Fails ❌

```python
# DON'T DO THIS
async def unreliable_multi_agent(task):
    subtasks = await main_agent.decompose(task)
    
    # Parallel execution = Chaos
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        agent_1.execute(subtasks[0]),
        agent_2.execute(subtasks[1])
    )
    
    return await main_agent.combine(results)
```

Real example: "Build a Flappy Bird clone"
- Agent 1: Dark, realistic graphics 
- Agent 2: Colorful, cartoon style
- Result: A Frankenstein mess

## The Architecture That Works ✅

```python
# DO THIS INSTEAD
def reliable_linear_agent(task):
    context = {"task": task, "history": []}
    
    # Sequential execution with full context
    plan = main_agent.create_plan(context)
    context["history"].append(plan)
    
    result1 = agent_1.execute(context)
    context["history"].append(result1)
    
    # Agent 2 sees EVERYTHING
    result2 = agent_2.execute(context)
    
    return main_agent.finalize(context)
```

## Context Engineering > Multi-Agent Complexity 🎯

The real game-changer isn't having more agents—it's giving your agents better context. Even the smartest person can't do their job without proper information. Same for AI.

## Learning from the Best 🏆

**Claude Code**: Never runs parallel subtasks. Sub-agents only answer questions. Only the main agent writes code.

**Devon**: Linear execution. Full context propagation. No parallel coordination.

These aren't limitations—they're features!

## Your Action Plan 📋

1. **Abandon parallel multi-agent frameworks**
2. **Use linear architectures with full context**
3. **Master context engineering, not agent orchestration**
4. **Measure reliability as your north star**

The companies building the most advanced AI agents (Cognition, Anthropic, OpenAI) all reached the same conclusion: simple architectures with rich context beat complex architectures every time.
