## The Hard Truth About Multi-Agent Systems

After building AI systems for enterprise clients and running an AI startup with 50,000+ users, I've learned an uncomfortable truth:

**The multi-agent architectures that big tech companies promote almost never work in production.**

OpenAI pushes Swarm. Microsoft promotes Autogen. But the creators of Devon (Cognition AI) just revealed why these approaches fail—and what actually works.

## The Two Principles That Change Everything

### 🎯 Principle 1: Share Context
Every agent needs the FULL picture. Not summaries. Not filtered views. Complete context of all decisions and actions.

### 🎯 Principle 2: Actions Carry Implicit Decisions
When agents act independently, they make conflicting assumptions. These conflicts compound into system-wide failures.

## What Doesn't Work (And Why)

❌ **Parallel Agent Systems**: Multiple agents working simultaneously without seeing each other's work
❌ **Filtered Context Sharing**: Agents receiving only "relevant" information
❌ **Complex Orchestration**: Over-engineered coordination mechanisms

Real-world example: Task "Build a mobile game prototype"
- Agent 1: Creates dark, realistic graphics
- Agent 2: Builds colorful, cartoonish mechanics
- Result: Incompatible components that can't work together

## What Actually Works

✅ **Linear, Sequential Execution**: Agents work one after another with full visibility
✅ **Complete Context Propagation**: Every agent sees all previous work and decisions
✅ **Simple Architectures**: Reliability through simplicity, not complexity

The most successful AI agents (Devon, Claude Code) all follow this pattern. They prioritize context over parallelism.

## The Business Impact

For organizations building AI agents:

🔹 **Reduced Development Time**: Simple architectures are faster to build and debug
🔹 **Higher Reliability**: Sequential execution eliminates entire classes of failures
🔹 **Lower Maintenance Costs**: Fewer moving parts mean fewer things to break
🔹 **Better Predictability**: Linear flows are easier to understand and monitor

## Key Takeaway for AI Leaders

Stop chasing the multi-agent dream. The future isn't about orchestrating complex agent teams—it's about **context engineering**: giving single agent chains the information they need to succeed.

The companies building the most advanced AI agents have all reached the same conclusion: simple architectures with rich context beat complex architectures every time.

💡 **Action Item**: If you're building AI agents, audit your architecture. Are you adding complexity where context would suffice?
