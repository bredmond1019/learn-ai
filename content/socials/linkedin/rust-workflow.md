ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest open-source project: AI Workflow Engine - a production-ready orchestration platform built in Rust!

Key highlights:
âœ… Multi-provider AI integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock)
âœ… Event sourcing for complete audit trails
âœ… 15,000+ requests/second throughput
âœ… WebAssembly plugin system for safe extensibility
âœ… Real-time WebSocket support for 10,000+ concurrent connections

This platform demonstrates how Rust's performance and safety guarantees can power enterprise AI systems that are both scalable and trustworthy.

Perfect for teams building:
â€¢ Complex AI orchestration workflows
â€¢ Multi-tenant SaaS platforms
â€¢ Real-time AI applications
â€¢ Systems requiring compliance and auditability
