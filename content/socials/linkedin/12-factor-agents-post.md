# LinkedIn Post: 12-Factor Agents

🤖 Why do most AI agents hit a wall at 70-80% functionality?

After analyzing 100+ production implementations, the pattern is clear: The most successful agents aren't the most "agentic" — they're well-engineered SOFTWARE systems.

Here's what separates production agents from impressive demos:

🏗️ **Foundation Principles:**
• JSON extraction is THE core capability
• Own your prompts (no magic abstractions)
• "Tool use" = JSON routing to functions

📊 **State Management:**
• Explicit context window control
• Stateless design for scale
• Separate business from execution state

👥 **Human Integration:**
• Make human contact a first-class operation
• Meet users where they are (Email, Slack, etc.)

🚀 **Production Patterns:**
• Small agents (3-10 steps) > Monoliths
• Micro-agent composition
• Engineer reliability at the model's edge

The key insight? Agents are just:
Prompt + Switch Statement + Context Manager + Loop

That's it. No magic.

I've created a comprehensive learning path covering all 12 factors with hands-on exercises and production examples.
