## **Who This Is For:**
- Developers wanting to 10x their productivity
- Teams looking to adopt AI-assisted development
- Engineers curious about the future of programming
- Anyone who's tried AI coding tools but hasn't seen the full potential

## **The Impact Is Real:**

At Anthropic, onboarding time dropped from 2-3 weeks to 2 days. Developers are shipping production features in hours that used to take weeks. This isn't hype - it's happening now.

The question isn't whether to adopt AI-assisted development, but how quickly you can master it.
