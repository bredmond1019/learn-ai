## Implementation Notes

1. **One test at a time**: Implement each checkbox as a single test following TDD cycle
2. **Red first**: Write failing test before implementation
3. **Minimal implementation**: Write just enough code to make test pass
4. **Refactor when green**: Only refactor with passing tests
5. **Commit discipline**: Separate structural and behavioral changes
6. **Run all tests**: After each new test passes, run full suite

## Current Status

**Completed Phases:**
- âœ… Phase 1: Fixed existing component tests - established green baseline
- âœ… Phase 2: Core component tests (Hero, Navigation, LanguageSwitcher)
- âœ… Phase 3: Learning system tests (ModuleRenderer, Navigation, Progress)
- âœ… Phase 4: Blog system tests (List Page, Detail Page, BlogCardServer)
- âœ… Phase 5: Project system tests (Projects Page, ProjectsPageClient, Project Detail Page)
- âœ… Phase 6: API route tests (Contact API, Progress API)
- âœ… Phase 7: Utility function tests (Translation, MDX, Image optimization)

**Next Phase:** Phase 8 - Integration Tests

Successfully completed comprehensive utility function tests following TDD methodology. All translation, MDX processing, and image optimization utilities are thoroughly tested and validated.
