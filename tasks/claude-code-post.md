## Key Themes to Cover

1. **Historical Context**: Evolution from punch cards to AI agents
2. **Unopinionated Design**: Why Claude Code stays minimal and flexible
3. **Model vs Product**: How the exponential model growth outpaces product development
4. **Practical Usage**: Real workflows and tips from Boris
5. **Future Vision**: Where AI-assisted coding is heading

## Important Quotes to Include

- "The model is moving really fast... the product is kind of struggling to keep up"
- "The more general model always wins"
- "We're trying to stay unopinionated about what the product should look like because we don't know"
- "It's shortened onboarding times from like two or three weeks to like two days"

## Code Examples Needed

1. Basic Claude Code terminal usage
2. IDE integration example
3. GitHub integration setup
4. SDK usage for custom integration
5. TDD workflow example
6. Memory and context management
7. Unix pipe examples with claude -p
