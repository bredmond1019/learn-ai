## Work Completed So Far

- **Dev.to API Integration**: Built a complete TypeScript library for interacting with the Dev.to API, including article creation, updates, and user article retrieval

- **CLI Publishing Tool**: Developed a full-featured command-line interface for publishing, updating, and managing Dev.to articles with beautiful console output
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Created 78 tests across all modules achieving 100% code coverage for the Dev.to functionality
- **Published Content**: Successfully published 6 articles to Dev.to (5-part AI Systems series + Rust workflow article)
- **Documentation**: Created detailed documentation for Dev.to usage and updated main CLAUDE.md with new functionality

## Most Recent Work

- **Fixed CLI list command**: Added proper async loading to the list command to ensure mappings are loaded before display

## Open Questions

- **Series management**: Should we add automatic series detection and ordering based on file names?
- **Draft workflow**: How should we handle draft articles that aren't ready for publication?
- **Image handling**: Should we implement automatic image upload to Dev.to or use external hosting?
- **Canonical URLs**: Should articles automatically set canonical URL to the portfolio blog?
- **Comment moderation**: Do we need integration with Dev.to's comment API for moderation?
