Let's create another learning path: AI Systems: An Introduction.

- Review the current learning paths at `content/learn/paths`
- Create a new learning path about AI Systems: An Introduction with the same structure.
  - The goal should have very readable code examples
  - be a good introduction to AI Systems for beginners and not too technical folks.
  - The module should get them a basic understanding of a workflow engine coupled with AI Agents, a simple LLM, and MCP Servers -- and examples of the practical things we could build with them for everyday people and small businesses.
  - Let's use graphs with nodes and edges to represent the workflow engine and the MCP Servers and Agents.
  - A lot more graphs and diagrams than we usually use.
  - The tone should be our normal saved tone for writing articles.
  - The first 5 modules or so should have barely any code examples and be easy for non tech people to understand and see the big picture and the benefit of AI Systems in their lives or businesses.
- The last 3 - X modules should be a walkthrough on how to get a running very simple AI System up and running with MCP Servers, Agents, and LLMs to solve a real problem for a small business or everyday person. Again using the Python MCP SDK throughout.
  - We should use the Python MCP SDK in our examples and talk about how to use the MCP SDK to build AI Systems.

Let's do everything in English first.
Let's use our normal saved tone for writing articles.
Feel free to extend the learning path to 10 modules or more if you think it's necessary. The important thing is to get the big picture and the benefit of AI Systems in their lives or businesses.
