## Key Concepts to Cover

### From the Talk:
1. **Memory Types**
   - Short-term vs Long-term
   - Conversational memory
   - Entity memory
   - Knowledge/semantic memory
   - Episodic memory
   - Procedural memory
   - Working memory
   - Persona memory
   - Toolbox memory
   - Workflow memory

2. **Memory Management Components**
   - Generation
   - Storage
   - Retrieval
   - Integration
   - Updating
   - Deletion/Forgetting mechanisms

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - MongoDB as memory provider
   - RAG vs Agentic RAG
   - Memory signals (recall, recency)
   - Voyage AI embeddings
   - Chunking strategies

4. **Business Value**
   - Making agents believable, capable, reliable
   - Building relationships with customers
   - Reducing prompt engineering
   - Stateful applications

## Notes
- Richmond Alake works at MongoDB
- Mentions "Memoripy" library (open source)
- Focus on neuroscience-inspired approaches
- Emphasize practical implementation with code
