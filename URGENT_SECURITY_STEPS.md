# URGENT: Security Steps Required

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Regenerate Your Resend API Key NOW

1. Go to https://resend.com/api-keys
2. Find the exposed key (starts with `re_ZSyxf1Pz`)
3. Click "Revoke" or "Delete" on this key
4. Create a new API key
5. Update the new key in Vercel:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Update RESEND_API_KEY with the new value

### 2. Remove API Key from Git History

The API key was exposed in commit c09459f. To completely remove it:

```bash
# Option 1: Force push to rewrite history (if you're the only one working on this)
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env.production VERCEL_EMAIL_FIX.md scripts/verify-vercel-env.ts" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Then force push
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```

Or use BFG Repo-Cleaner (easier):

```bash
# Install BFG
brew install bfg

# Remove the specific string from all history
bfg --replace-text <(echo "re_ZSyxf1Pz_Mi226SjzLgSJh3F6ZbauqiHW==>REMOVED") .

# Clean up
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Force push
git push origin --force --all
```

### 3. Check for Other Exposures

Run these commands to ensure the key isn't exposed elsewhere:

```bash
# Search your entire codebase
grep -r "re_ZSyxf1Pz" . --exclude-dir=.git

# Check GitHub for cached versions
# Go to: https://github.com/bredmond1019/learn-ai/search?q=re_ZSyxf1Pz
```

### 4. Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Never commit .env files** - They're already in .gitignore
2. **Use placeholders in documentation** - Never put real keys in docs
3. **Use GitHub Secrets** - For GitHub Actions
4. **Regular key rotation** - Change API keys periodically

## Why This Matters

- Anyone who saw your repository could use your API key
- They could send emails on your behalf
- They could exhaust your Resend quota
- This could result in unexpected charges

## Prevention

Consider using tools like:
- `git-secrets` - Prevents committing secrets
- `pre-commit` hooks - Scan for secrets before commits
- `gitleaks` - Scan for secrets in your repository

Act on this immediately! The key has been public since the commit was pushed.
